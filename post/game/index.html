          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Right near the entrance, there was a small waiting room.<br>
On the left there was a long green couch with a white cover on the worn out cream-colored carpet.<br>
The wall clock made a ticking sound as it approached three o'clock.<br>
The right side appeared to be the examination room.<br>
Shogo jammed the door shut with a broom and then signaled Shuya, &quot;Over here.&quot;<br>
Although they were supposed to take their shoes off, Shuya stepped up with his sneakers on and entered the room on the right.<br>
There was a wooden desk in front of the window, and what appeared to be a doctor's black leather chair.<br>
There was a green vinyl stool in front of it.<br>
Even though the clinic was small, it still had the sterile odor of disinfectant.<br>
There were two beds beyond a thin green curtain hanging from metal pipes.<br>
Shuya carried Noriko to the bed in front and gently put her down there.<br>
He thought of having her take off his school coat, but then decided against it.<br>
After Shogo quickly pulled the curtains shut, he said, &quot;blankets,&quot; and gave him two thin brown blankets folded in small squares.<br>
Shuya took them and after some thought spread one of them on the other bed.<br>
Then he moved Noriko there and spread the other blanket over her.<br>
He made sure the blanket went up to her shoulders.<br>
Shogo was rummaging through a gray office cabinet that was probably the medicine cabinet.<br>
Shuya crouched down by Noriko's head and combed the sweaty hair against her cheeks back to her ears.<br>
She seemed dazed.<br>
Her eyes were closed, and she continued to breathe heavily.<br>
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Shuya muttered.<br>
&quot;Noriko, are you all right?&quot;<br>
Noriko squinted, her eyes glazed at him as she said, &quot;Uh huh…&quot; She might be faint from the high fever, but her mind was clear enough to respond.<br>
&quot;How about some water?&quot;<br>
Noriko barely nodded.<br>
Shuya took out a new bottle of water from the day pack Shogo had tossed onto the floor and tore off the seal.<br>
He held her up and helped her drink it.<br>
Shuya wiped off the water spilling from the side of her mouth with the back of his hand.<br>
&quot;Is that enough?&quot; Shuya asked and Noriko nodded.<br>
Then he lay her down and waved to Shogo.<br>
&quot;Any medicine?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Shogo replied.<br>
He rummaged through another, lower cabinet and pulled out a cardboard box.<br>
He opened it and read the directions.<br>
It seemed to be what he was after.<br>
He extracted what looked like a small bottle and an ampoule.<br>
The bottle was filled with white powder.<br>
&quot;Do you swallow that?&quot; Shuya asked.<br>
Shogo answered, &quot;No, it's for injections.&quot;<br>
Shuya was a little shocked.<br>
&quot;You know how to use that?&quot;<br>
Shogo turned on the faucet in the back of the room.<br>
No water came out, as expected, and Shogo clicked his tongue.<br>
He pulled out his water bottle from his day pack and washed his hands.<br>
Then he set a needle on a syringe and extracted the contents of the ampoule.<br>
&quot;Don't worry, I've done this before.&quot;<br>
&quot;…really?&quot; Shuya felt like he was constantly repeating this phrase to Shogo.<br>
Shogo broke the seal of the small bottle and injected it with the syringe, filling it up with the liquid from the ampoule.<br>
After removing the syringe, he held the bottle and shook it vigorously.<br>
Then he injected the syringe again to extract the liquid mixture.<br>
After preparing another syringe like this, he finally approached them.<br>
&quot;Is she going to be all right?&quot; Shuya asked again.<br>
&quot;What about side effects or shock?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's what I'm going to check for now.<br>
Just do as I say.<br>
Pull out Noriko's arm.&quot;<br>
Unsure of the situation, Shuya lifted the side of the blanket and rolled up both the sleeves of his school coat and her sailor suit.<br>
Her arm was very thin and her healthy looking dark skin had now become excruciatingly white.<br>
&quot;Noriko,&quot; Shogo asked her, &quot;have you ever had any allergic reactions to any medicine?&quot;<br>
Noriko opened her eyes again in a daze.<br>
Shogo repeated, &quot;Are you allergic to any medicine?&quot;<br>
Noriko shook her head slightly.<br>
&quot;Good.<br>
I'm going to test you first though.&quot;<br>
Shogo held her arm out with her palm up, then took a cotton swab soaked with disinfectant and wiped the area between her wrist and elbow.<br>
He slowly inserted the needle, injecting only a small amount of the liquid.<br>
A slight bump formed on this area of her skin.<br>
Shogo took out another syringe and performed another injection.<br>
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Shuya asked.<br>
&quot;One of them is real medicine.<br>
If she's in the same condition fifteen minutes later, we won't have to worry about side effects.<br>
It means we can probably use the medicine.<br>
But…&quot;<br>
&quot;But?&quot;<br>
Shogo quickly took out another larger bottle from the cardboard box.<br>
He placed it on the small desk nearby, prepared another syringe, and looked over at Shuya.<br>
&quot;It's not easy to diagnose septicemia.<br>
To be honest I can't tell whether this is from septicemia or just a cold.<br>
Antibiotics are pretty potent, and that's why we're testing this on her, but the fact is my experience and knowledge is pretty limited, so injecting her with this syringe could be pretty dicey.<br>
On the other hand…&quot;<br>
Holding Noriko's hand, Shuya waited for him to continue.<br>
Shogo took a breath and continued, &quot;If she is suffering from septicemia, then we have to treat her as soon as possible.<br>
Otherwise, it'll be too late.&quot;<br>
Fifteen minutes passed by quickly.<br>
In the meantime, Shogo checked her pulse again and took her temperature.<br>
The thermometer read 39 degrees Celsius.<br>
No wonder she could barely stand.<br>
Shuya couldn't tell the difference between the two adjacent marks from the syringes.<br>
Shogo also appeared to reach the same conclusion and took the larger syringe.<br>
Crouching down slightly, Shogo asked, &quot;Noriko.<br>
Are you awake?&quot;<br>
Noriko answered with her eyes shut, &quot;Uh huh…&quot;<br>
&quot;I'll be honest.<br>
I don't know if you're suffering from septicemia or not.<br>
I think you probably are.&quot;<br>
Noriko nodded slightly.<br>
She must have been able to follow Shuya and Shogo's conversation moments ago.<br>
&quot;It's all right…go ahead.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded and inserted the syringe, this time deeply.<br>
He injected the liquid and removed the needle.<br>
Then he wiped her arm with the cotton and told Shuya,<br>
&quot;Hold this.&quot;<br>
Shogo took the empty syringe and walked over to the sink to toss it away.<br>
Then he came back.<br>
&quot;Now she's got to sleep.<br>
You look after her for a while.<br>
If she looks thirsty, you can use the whole bottle.&quot;<br>
Shuya said, &quot;But that's—&quot;<br>
Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;Don't worry.<br>
I found a well behind the building.<br>
As long as we boil the water we can drink it.&quot; Shogo left the room.<br>
Shuya turned towards the bed.<br>
With his right hand pressing the cotton swab and his left hand gently holding Noriko's hand, he watched over her.<br>
22 students remaining<br>
42<br>
Noriko fell asleep almost immediately.<br>
Shuya checked to make sure she wasn't bleeding from the shot, then he tossed the cotton swab, tucked her arm under the blanket, and left the room.<br>
The doctor's living quarters was beyond the waiting room next door.<br>
There was a kitchen at the end of the hall on the right.<br>
Shogo was in there.<br>
The gas stove next to the sink wasn't operating, but on it was a large pot filled with water, and under it a pile of charcoal was glowing red.<br>
Shogo was standing on a table, looking through a built-in ceiling cabinet across from the sink.<br>
That's when Shuya noticed for the first time that Shogo was wearing New Balance sneakers.<br>
He'd assumed they were some domestic brand like Mizumo or Kageboshi.<br>
New Balance! He'd never seen them before!<br>
Whatever.<br>
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked.<br>
&quot;I'm looking for food.<br>
I found some rice and miso, but nothing else.<br>
The vegetables in the fridge are rotten.&quot;<br>
Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;You're stealing.&quot;<br>
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; Shogo said dryly and then added while he continued rummaging, &quot;Forget about it.<br>
Just be ready.<br>
Anyone could show up at any moment.<br>
If the machine gun shooter shows up, we'll be dead.<br>
So be ready.&quot;<br>
Shuya replied, &quot;Yeah, all right.&quot;<br>
Shogo jumped off the table.<br>
The New Balance shoes squeaked against the floor.<br>
&quot;Is she asleep?&quot; he asked.<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
Shogo pulled out another pot from under the sink, walked up to the plastic rice container in the corner, and poured rice into the pot.<br>
&quot;So you're boiling rice.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right.<br>
Noriko won't recover eating that terrible bread.&quot; Shogo scooped up a bowl of water from the bucket on the floor and poured it into the pot.<br>
He combed through the rice and only changed the water once.<br>
Next to the boiling water, he placed several pieces of charcoal from his day pack onto the other burner, then took out a pack of cigarettes and emptied them into his pocket.<br>
Then he crumpled the pack, lit it with his lighter, and stuck it into the charcoal.<br>
Once the charcoal was lit, he put the lidded pot of rice on the burner.<br>
It was an impressive sight.<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
Shogo took a break as he lit up a cigarette and looked at Shuya.<br>
&quot;You're so good at everything.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Shogo answered lightly.<br>
But something else flashed through Shuya's mind.<br>
The moment Kaori Minami was murdered…you know what's going to happen but there's nothing you can do to stop it.<br>
Slow motion.<br>
Kaori spins around and the left side of her head's blown off.<br>
It was blown away, did you see that?…If it had been Shogo instead of Shuya, the outcome wouldn't have been so horrible.<br>
&quot;Are you still bummed about Kaori?&quot; Shogo said.<br>
Once again, Shogo's psychic powers were on.<br>
The sunlight doesn't reach this far inside, but that didn't seem to affect him.<br>
Shogo shook his head.<br>
&quot;Don't let it get to you.<br>
It was a bad situation.<br>
You did your best.&quot;<br>
Shogo's voice was kind, but Shuya looked down.<br>
The corpse of Kaori Minami, collapsed on her side inside a grimy farm equipment shack.<br>
The pool of blood gradually spreading, oozing outward.<br>
By now, beginning to congeal.<br>
But the body would just stay there, with no ceremony, just left there like a disposed mannequin sprawled inside that shack.<br>
Of course in that sense she was no exception to Tatsumichi Oki, Kyoichi Motobuchi, Yukiko Kitano, and Yumiko Kusaka.<br>
That's right, everyone else was in the same boat.<br>
He felt like puking.<br>
They were all lying there, on the ground.<br>
Already close to twenty of them.<br>
&quot;Shogo.&quot; The words spilled out.<br>
In response Shogo tilted his head and slightly moved his hand that was holding the cigarette.<br>
&quot;What happens to the dead…their bodies?&quot; Shuya asked.<br>
&quot;Are they left there until this stupid game is over? So they just start rotting while the game is going on?&quot;<br>
Shogo answered as if it were an official matter.<br>
&quot;That's right.<br>
Once it's over, the following day a clean-up crew is hired to take care of them.&quot;<br>
&quot;…clean-up crew?&quot; Shuya bared his teeth.<br>
&quot;Yep.<br>
I heard about it from someone who works for the subcontractor, so I'm sure it's true.<br>
Self Defense Forces soldiers are too proud to perform such menial tasks.<br>
Of course, government officials accompany the crew to collect the collars and examine the bodies.<br>
You know, so the news media can report the number of deaths by strangulation, all that stuff.&quot;<br>
Shuya was pissed.<br>
He recalled that final part of the news report.<br>
The meaningless causes of deaths and itemization of each student.<br>
But he also realized something and knit his brows.<br>
Shogo saw this and asked, &quot;What's up?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well…that doesn't make sense.<br>
I mean these…&quot; Shuya raised his hand up to his neck.<br>
His fingers touched the collar's cold surface, its sensation no longer so strange.<br>
&quot;I thought these were a secret.<br>
Shouldn't they collect them before the hired hands come in?&quot;<br>
Shogo shrugged.<br>
&quot;The cleaning crew have no idea what they're for.<br>
They probably just assume they're used as markers.<br>
The guy I talked to didn't even remember them until I asked him about them.<br>
So there's no rush.<br>
They can deal with the collars after the clean-up crew's collected the bodies, right?&quot;<br>
It was true.<br>
But even so, something else bugged him.<br>
&quot;Hold on.<br>
What if one of these is defective? Let's say it breaks down and someone who's alive is assumed to be dead.<br>
Couldn't that student escape? Shouldn't they confirm all the dead right after the game?&quot;<br>
Shogo raised his brows.<br>
&quot;You talk like you work for the government.&quot;<br>
&quot;No…&quot; he stammered.<br>
&quot;It's just that—&quot;<br>
&quot;I doubt they could ever be defective.<br>
Think about it.<br>
If they actually could break down, this game couldn't proceed smoothly.<br>
Besides, if a student equipped with weapons turned out to be alive, they couldn't even afford to check the bodies.<br>
It'd turn into another battle.&quot; Shogo took a drag as he considered it more thoroughly.<br>
&quot;This is just my guess, but I think each collar is loaded with multiple systems, so that if one breaks down, another gets switched on.<br>
Even if one system became defective—the chances of that being at least less than one in a hundred—if the systems were combined the probability would practically be reduced to zero.<br>
In other words,&quot; he said, looking at Shuya, &quot;it would be impossible for us to escape that way.&quot;<br>
Shuya understood.<br>
He saw no reason not to object.<br>
(Once again, he couldn't help but be impressed by Shogo's intelligence.)<br>
But then—<br>
The question he promised not to ask crossed his mind.<br>
Which was: How did Shogo plan to beat a perfect, escape-proof system?<br>
Before he could consider it, Shogo said, &quot;Anyway, look, I have to apologize.&quot;<br>
&quot;About what?&quot;<br>
&quot;About Noriko.<br>
I was wrong.<br>
We should have treated her sooner.&quot;<br>
&quot;No…&quot; Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;It's okay.<br>
Thanks.<br>
I would have been useless on my own.&quot;<br>
Shogo exhaled and fixed his gaze on a part of the wall.<br>
&quot;We'll just have to wait and see.<br>
If it's just a cold, then her fever will go down as soon as she gets some rest.<br>
And if it turns out it's from septicemia then the medicine should kick in.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
He was grateful they had Shogo.<br>
Without Shogo, he would have been helpless, doomed to watch Noriko deteriorate.<br>
He was also sorry for saying to Shogo, &quot;You can forget about our deal,&quot;<br>
and heading off here.<br>
It was immature.<br>
Shogo must have made his decision after carefully weighing the risk of moving during the day against Noriko's condition.<br>
Shuya decided he should apologize.<br>
&quot;Hey, I'm sorry.<br>
Saying you were on your own and all.<br>
I just got so excited—&quot;<br>
Still looking away from Shuya, Shogo shook his head and smiled.<br>
&quot;No.<br>
You made the right decision.<br>
End of conversation.&quot;<br>
Shuya took a breath and decided to let it go.<br>
Then he asked, &quot;Is your father still a practicing doctor?&quot;<br>
Shogo shook his head as he took a drag.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
&quot;What's he doing? Is he still in Kobe?&quot;<br>
&quot;No.<br>
He died.&quot; Shogo said it casually.<br>
Shuya's eyes opened wide.<br>
&quot;When?&quot;<br>
&quot;Last year, while I was playing this game.<br>
By the time I got back he was dead.<br>
He probably got in a scuffle with the government.&quot;<br>
Shuya's face stiffened.<br>
He was beginning to understand the glimmer in Shogo's eyes when he'd said, &quot;I'm going to tear up this fucking country.&quot; The moment Shogo ended up in the Program, Shogo's father must have tried some kind of protest.<br>
Which must have been met with a shower of bullets.<br>
It occurred to Shuya that the parents of some of his classmates might have ended up the same way.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.<br>
I didn't mean to pry.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't worry about it.&quot;<br>
Shuya paused and then asked another question, &quot;Then you moved to Kagawa Prefecture with your mother?&quot;<br>
Shogo shook his head and again replied, &quot;No.<br>
My mom died when I was a kid.<br>
I was seven.<br>
She died from illness.<br>
My dad used to cry over the fact that he couldn't even save her.<br>
But my dad specialized in surgery, like abortions.<br>
Nervous disorders were out of his field.&quot;<br>
Shuya apologized again, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
Shogo chuckled.<br>
&quot;Hey, it's all right.<br>
We both don't have parents, right? And it's true about getting a lifetime pension.<br>
I've got enough to live on.<br>
Although they don't give you as much as they say they do.&quot;<br>
Bubbles began to form at the bottom of the first large pot.<br>
The charcoal under the rice pot was still mostly black, but the charcoal under the large pot was flaming red.<br>
The heat reached the table where Shuya and Shogo were standing next to each other.<br>
Shuya sat up on the table, which was covered with a flower-pattern vinyl tablecloth.<br>
Without warning, Shogo suddenly said, &quot;You were good friends with Yoshitoki Kuninobu.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked over at Shogo and looked at his profile.<br>
Then he looked ahead.<br>
It felt like a while since he'd last thought of Yoshitoki.<br>
He felt a little guilty about it.<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he answered.<br>
&quot;We've known each other forever.&quot; After hesitating a little, Shuya continued,<br>
&quot;Yoshitoki had a crush on Noriko.&quot;<br>
Shogo continued smoking, listening.<br>
Shuya wondered whether he should continue with what he was about to say.<br>
It had nothing to do with Shogo.<br>
But he decided to tell him anyway.<br>
Shogo was a friend now.<br>
It was all right for him to know, and besides, they had time to kill right now.<br>
&quot;Yoshitoki and I were at this orphanage called the Charity House—&quot;<br>
&quot;I know.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded and continued, &quot;There're all kinds of kids there.<br>
I ended up there when I was five.<br>
My parents were killed in a car accident.<br>
But that's unusual.<br>
Most of them—&quot;<br>
Shogo understood.<br>
&quot;They end up there because of 'domestic' problems.<br>
They're illegitimate children.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;So you know.&quot;<br>
&quot;A little.&quot;<br>
He took a deep breath.<br>
&quot;Well, Yoshitoki was illegitimate.<br>
Of course, no one at the orphanage told him, but there are ways to find out.<br>
He was conceived from an 'illicit affair' and both sides refused to take him in.<br>
So…&quot;<br>
The water made a gurgling sound.<br>
&quot;I remember something Yoshitoki once said to me.<br>
It was a long time ago, probably when we were still in elementary school.&quot;<br>
Shuya recalled that moment.<br>
They were in the corner of the school playground, rocking back and forth on a big swing made of a wooden log and wire rope.<br>
&quot;Hey, Shuya.<br>
I was thinking—&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
Shuya responded in his usual casual voice, kicking at the ground to rock the log.<br>
Yoshitoki didn't put much effort into it, letting his legs dangle from both sides of the log.<br>
&quot;Well…uh…&quot;<br>
&quot;What is it? Spit it out.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well…do you have a crush on anyone?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, please,&quot; Shuya grinned.<br>
He knew it was something about girls.<br>
&quot;So that's it? What's the matter? You have a crush on someone, huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well…&quot; Yoshitoki evaded the question and once again asked, &quot;Well, do you?&quot;<br>
Shuya thought about it and then moaned, &quot;Hmmm.&quot;<br>
By then he was &quot;Wild Seven.&quot; So he'd gotten several love letters.<br>
But at the time he never fell head over heels for anyone in particular.<br>
As it turned out, he wouldn't until he met Kazumi Shintani.<br>
He answered, &quot;Well, I think there're some cool girls…&quot;<br>
Yoshitoki didn't say anything back so he assumed he wanted to hear more.<br>
He continued speaking in a light tone, &quot;Komoto's not bad.<br>
She actually wrote me a love letter.<br>
I haven't, uh, responded though.<br>
Then there's Utsumi, who's on the volleyball team.<br>
She's pretty cool.<br>
That's my type.<br>
You know, real outgoing.&quot;<br>
Yoshitoki looked pensive.<br>
&quot;What is it? I told you, now you tell me.<br>
Who is it?&quot;<br>
But Yoshitoki only said, &quot;No, that's not it.&quot;<br>
Shuya knit his brows.<br>
&quot;What is it then?&quot;<br>
Yoshitoki seemed quite hesitant, but then he said, &quot;You see, I never really understood.&quot;<br>
&quot;?&quot;<br>
&quot;I mean…&quot; His legs dangled passively as he continued, &quot;I think if you really loved someone you'd marry her, right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; Shuya replied with an idiotic look on his face.<br>
&quot;Yeah.<br>
If…if I loved someone, I'd want to marry her…I mean I don't feel that way about anyone.&quot;<br>
&quot;Right?&quot; Yoshitoki said, as if it were only natural.<br>
Then he asked, &quot;So let's say you just can't get married for some reason.<br>
If you ended up having a kid with her, wouldn't you still want to raise the kid?&quot;<br>
Shuya felt a little uncomfortable.<br>
He'd just begun to get the idea of how babies were made.<br>
&quot;Having a kid? Hey, you're still a kid.<br>
That's dirty stuff.<br>
You know I heard that that's—&quot;<br>
That was when Shuya finally remembered Yoshitoki was born as a result of an illicit affair and that neither of his parents wanted him.<br>
Startled, he held back what he was about to say.<br>
Yoshitoki was staring at the log between his thighs.<br>
Then he mumbled, &quot;My parents weren't like that.&quot;<br>
Shuya suddenly felt really bad for him.<br>
&quot;H-hey, Yoshi—&quot; He looked up at Shuya and said somewhat forcefully, &quot;So I-I just don't know.<br>
Loving someone.<br>
I don't feel like I can trust that sort of thing.&quot;<br>
Shuya continued pushing with his legs, but he had no choice but to stare back at Yoshitoki.<br>
He felt as if he were being addressed in a language from another planet.<br>
At the same time, it sounded like a dreadful prophecy.<br>
&quot;I think—&quot;<br>
His hands by his waist, Shuya gripped the corners of the table covered with the vinyl tablecloth.<br>
Shogo continued smoking, squinting his eyes.<br>
&quot;I think Yoshitoki was a lot more mature at that point already.<br>
I was just a silly kid.<br>
And ever since then, Yoshitoki, even since we entered junior high, and I fell for someone,&quot; this was Kazumi Shintani, &quot;he never brought it up.<br>
That kind of worried me.&quot;<br>
Another gurgling sound.<br>
&quot;But then one day he told me he liked Noriko.<br>
I acted like it wasn't a big deal…but I was so happy for him.<br>
And that was, that was…&quot;<br>
Shuya looked away from Shogo.<br>
He knew he was about to cry.<br>
Once he managed to hold back his tears, he said without looking at Shogo and continued, &quot;That was only two months ago.&quot;<br>
Shogo remained silent.<br>
Shuya looked at Shogo again.<br>
&quot;So you see, I have to protect Noriko to the very end.&quot;<br>
After staring back at Shuya for a while, Shogo only said, &quot;I see,&quot; and rubbed out his cigarette out against the tablecloth.<br>
&quot;Don't tell Noriko.<br>
I'll tell her about Yoshitoki once we've gotten out of this game.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded and replied, &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
22 students remaining<br>
43<br>
Five hours had passed since the Macintosh PowerBook 150's connection to the internet had been cut off with a warning beep.<br>
Shinji Mimura scrolled through a document in one of the windows on the display monitor of the 150 that was now reduced to a word processor.<br>
He'd worked on the phone, checked the connections, and rebooted over and over but the gray monitor responded with the same message.<br>
Finally, after disconnecting all the modem and phone cords, he came to the conclusion his cell phone had completely broke down.<br>
Without a phone line he couldn't even access his home computer.<br>
And of course, calling all the girls he'd ever gone with and sobbing over how he was, &quot;About to die, but I loved you the most,&quot; was out of the question.<br>
He still believed he could get to the bottom of this and considered taking apart his cell phone—but then stopped.<br>
A chill ran down his spine.<br>
It was obvious now why he wasn't able to dial in anymore.<br>
The government had managed to locate the line test number used by the DTT technician, the number used for the special phone with the counterfeit<br>
&quot;Second ROM&quot; he'd painstakingly built.<br>
They'd cut off all connections including this one.<br>
The question was…how had they managed to do this? His hacking had been flawless.<br>
He knew that much.<br>
The only way he could imagine the government discovering his hacking was through some method outside their computer's internal security system, their warning system, and other manual monitoring systems.<br>
And now that they knew—<br>
The moment Shinji realized what it was, his hand went for the collar around his neck.<br>
Now that the government knew, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the bomb went off, would it? They probably wouldn't spare Yutaka either.<br>
Thanks to this realization, the government-supplied water and bread they had for lunch tasted even worse.<br>
After Yutaka saw Shinji turn off the laptop, he asked for an explanation.<br>
Shinji only replied, &quot;It's no good.<br>
I don't know why, but it's not working.<br>
Maybe the phone's broken.&quot;<br>
Ever since then Yutaka's mood became gloomy, and he slouched back to the way he'd been earlier that morning.<br>
Other than the occasional gunshots and brief exchanges it remained silent.<br>
Shinji's great escape plan that mesmerized Yutaka had completely fallen apart.<br>
But—<br>
I'll still make them regret they didn't kill me right away.<br>
No matter what.<br>
He thought a little, then dug into his pants pocket and pulled out an old pocketknife he carried around with him ever since he was a kid.<br>
There was a small tube tied to the keyring on the knife.<br>
Shinji examined the scratched up tube.<br>
His uncle had given him the knife a long time ago.<br>
And the tube was, that's right, like the earring on his left ear, another memento from his uncle.<br>
Like Shinji, his uncle had kept it chained to a small knife and always carried it around.<br>
The thumb-sized tube, with its rubber ring under the cap, was a waterproof case used by soldiers.<br>
It was normally used to hold a document with name, blood type, and history of illness in case of injury.<br>
Others used it as a matchbox.<br>
Until his death, Shinji assumed his uncle kept that sort of thing in it too.<br>
But after he died, when he opened the tube, Shinji found something completely different inside.<br>
In fact the tube's casing itself was carved out of a special alloy and contained two smaller cylinders inside.<br>
Shinji took out the two cylinders.<br>
He had no idea what they were.<br>
The only thing he could tell was that their contents were supposed to be mixed.<br>
The thread of the screw from one of the cylinders fit perfectly into the other one.<br>
The reason why they were kept apart was that it was risky to connect them.<br>
And once he found out what they were for, after some research (no wonder they were separate—otherwise, you couldn't carry those cases around), he still had no idea why his uncle carried this around wherever he went.<br>
It served no particular purpose.<br>
Or maybe like the earring Shinji wore, his uncle had merely held onto it to remind himself of someone.<br>
Anyway, it was another piece of evidence from his uncle's past for Shinji to ponder over.<br>
Shinji turned the squeaky cap and opened it.<br>
He hadn't opened it since his uncle died.<br>
He dropped the two cylinders into the palm of his hand.<br>
Then he opened the seal of the smaller cylinder.<br>
It had been stuffed with cotton to make it shockproof.<br>
There was the dull yellow of brass underneath the cotton.<br>
After examining it, he returned both cylinders back into the larger container and screwed the cap back on.<br>
He'd thought that if he ever had to use this, it would be after they escaped the island, or after messing up the school computer.<br>
It might have been handy after they equipped themselves and attacked Sakamochi and the others—but now this was all they had.<br>
He flipped out the blade from his pocketknife.<br>
The sun had moved west, and the bushes reflecting against the silver steel were dark yellow.<br>
Then he pulled out a pencil from his school coat pocket.<br>
It was the pencil they all used to write the phrase, &quot;We will kill,&quot; before the game began.<br>
Because he'd used it to mark the forbidden zones and check off the names of dead classmates, its point was now blunt.<br>
Shinji sharpened the pencil with his knife.<br>
Then he pulled out his map from another pocket and turned it over.<br>
It was blank.<br>
&quot;Yutaka.&quot;<br>
Yutaka had been hugging his knees and gazing at the ground.<br>
He looked up.<br>
His eyes were shining.<br>
&quot;Did you come up with something?&quot; he asked.<br>
Shinji wasn't exactly sure why Yutaka's response ticked him off.<br>
It might have been the tone of his voice, or maybe the words.<br>
Shinji felt like saying, what the hell—here I am banging my head against the wall trying to come up with an escape plan and all you've been doing is sitting on your ass! You swore you were going to get back at them for Izumi Kanai, but you haven't done squat.<br>
You think this is a fast food restaurant where I'm working the register? You want some fries with that?<br>
But Shinji restrained himself.<br>
Yutaka's round cheeks were sunken and his cheekbones stuck out.<br>
It was only natural.<br>
He must have been worn out by the pressure of this game that could end at any moment for them.<br>
Ever since he was a kid Shinji was always the best athlete in the class.<br>
(Although this changed in his second year in junior high, when he was joined by Shuya Nanahara and Kazuo Kiriyama.<br>
He could beat them in basketball, but he wasn't sure about other sports.) His uncle had taken him mountain climbing ever since he was a kid, and he was confident in any competition that required stamina.<br>
But not everyone was built like The Third Man.<br>
Yutaka was a poor athlete, and when the cold season came he was often absent.<br>
Fatigue must have been overwhelming him, and it might be numbing his thinking too.<br>
That was when Shinji realized something important.<br>
Wasn't the fact that he was even a little upset at Yutaka an indication of his own fatigue? Of course, given how their chances of survival were close to nil, it would have been much stranger not to be worn out.<br>
No.<br>
I have to be careful.<br>
If this were a basketball game, you'd just feel bad about losing—but in this game you end up dead.<br>
Shinji shook his head.<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Yutaka asked.<br>
Shinji looked up at him, forcing a smile.<br>
&quot;Nothing.<br>
Hey, I just want to take a look at the map.<br>
Okay?&quot;<br>
Yutaka came over to Shinji.<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; Shinji raised his voice.<br>
&quot;There's a bug on your neck!&quot;<br>
Yutaka touched his neck.<br>
&quot;I'll get it,&quot; Shinji stopped him and approached Yutaka.<br>
He fixed his eyes on the nape of Yutaka's neck—but he was searching for something else.<br>
&quot;Oh, it's moved,&quot; he said and got behind him.<br>
Shinji examined his neck again.<br>
&quot;Did you get it?&quot;<br>
As he listened to Yutaka's shrill, terrified voice, Shinji took a closer look.<br>
Then he lightly brushed away the nape of Yutaka's neck.<br>
He crushed the imaginary bug with the sole of his sneakers and (pretending) he picked it up and (pretending once again) tossed it out.<br>
&quot;I got it,&quot; he said.<br>
He was now facing Yutaka and added, &quot;Looked like a little centipede.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh man,&quot; Yutaka rubbed the nape of his neck and looked over where Shuya had (apparently) tossed it, grimacing.<br>
Shinji broke into a slight grin and said, &quot;Come on, let's look at the map.&quot;<br>
Yutaka looked over, then knit his brows when he saw that it was turned over.<br>
Shinji waved his index finger to get his attention and scribbled on the back of the map.<br>
His writing wasn't very neat.<br>
Several scrawled letters appeared at the edge of the paper.<br>
They can hear us.<br>
Yutaka's face twitched and asked, &quot;Really? How can you tell?&quot; Shinji quickly put his hand over Yutaka's mouth.<br>
Yutaka understood and nodded.<br>
Shinji released his hand and said, &quot;I just know.<br>
I know a lot about insects.<br>
That one wasn't poisonous.&quot;<br>
Then just to be sure, he scribbled again, Pretend to check map.<br>
Don't say anything to make them suspicious.<br>
&quot;Well, now that the computer's failed, there's nothing we can do,&quot; Shinji said, providing some fake commentary.<br>
Then he wrote: They heard my explanation and cut the Mac connection.<br>
I screwed up.<br>
They know some of us are going to resist so they're monitoring our conversation.<br>
Should have known.<br>
Yutaka took out his pencil from his pocket and wrote under Shinji's scrawled letters.<br>
His writing was much neater than Shinji's.<br>
How can they use a monitoring devise on such a big island? He had copied Shinji's spelling for monitoring, but &quot;device&quot; was spelled incorrectly.<br>
Whatever.<br>
This wasn't composition class.<br>
&quot;So I think we should look for others.<br>
We can't do much on our own.<br>
So…&quot; Shinji said as he lightly tapped on his collar with his finger.<br>
Yutaka's eyes widened as he nodded.<br>
Shinji then scribbled again: I checked your collar.<br>
It doesn't seem to have a camera.<br>
Only listening device.<br>
I don't think they're any cameras in the area.<br>
Maybe satallites, but the woods are covering us.<br>
They can't see what we're doing now.<br>
Spelling wasn't Shinji's strongest suit either.<br>
Yutaka's eyes widened again, and he glanced upward.<br>
The branches were swaying, cutting them off completely from the blue sky.<br>
Yutaka's face then stiffened suddenly as if he'd realized something.<br>
He gripped his pencil and wrote on the back of the map: Mac stopped working because you told me about it.<br>
If not for me, you would have succeeded!<br>
Shinji poked Yutaka's shoulder with the index finger of his left hand and smiled at him.<br>
Then he scribbled: Don't sweat it.<br>
Should have been more careful.<br>
Collars could have gone off the moment they heard, but they're &quot;mercifully&quot; letting us live.<br>
Yutaka touched the nape of his neck, eyes wide.<br>
He stared at Shinji and then tightened his lips and nodded.<br>
Shinji nodded back at him.<br>
&quot;I wonder where they're hiding out—&quot;<br>
I'm writing my plan here.<br>
Fake our conversation.<br>
Just go with the flow.<br>
Yutaka nodded and then quickly responded, &quot;Hmm, but I'm not sure we can trust anyone.&quot;<br>
Good going.<br>
Shinji grinned.<br>
Yutaka grinned back.<br>
&quot;That's true.<br>
I think we can trust Shuya.<br>
I want to hook up with Shuya.&quot;<br>
If comp worked we could have saved others but now we can only worry about saving ourselves.<br>
All right with that?<br>
Yutaka considered it and then wrote, Not looking for Shuya?<br>
Right.<br>
Can't afford to worry about others anymore.<br>
Yutaka bit his lip, but finally nodded.<br>
Shinji nodded back.<br>
If this works out, game will get held up.<br>
Might give others chance to escape.<br>
Yutaka gave two small nods.<br>
&quot;You think everyone's hiding in the mountain like us? Maybe some of them are hiding in houses?&quot;<br>
&quot;Maybe…&quot;<br>
Shinji was deliberating over what to write next when Yutaka wrote, What's the plan?<br>
Shinji nodded and gripped his pencil.<br>
I've been waiting for something to happen since morning.<br>
Yutaka tilted his head, his pencil down.<br>
Announcement that game has been canseled.<br>
I'm still waiting<br>
.<br>
Yutaka looked surprised and tilted his head in bewilderment.<br>
Shinji grinned at him.<br>
When I got access to school comp, I found all backup files.<br>
And file search apps.<br>
Then before I downloaded, I infected them all with virus.<br>
Yutaka silently formed the word &quot;virus?&quot; with his mouth.<br>
Hey, Yutaka, how about writing it out?<br>
Shinji wrote, Virus would enter school comp system if they search files or backups.<br>
Would wreak havoc on the system and freeze game.<br>
Impressed, Yutaka gave several brief nods.<br>
Shinji knew it was a waste of time, but wrote it out anyway, I designed virus.<br>
It's cool.<br>
It's like getting athlete's foot, but 100x worse.<br>
Yutaka held back the urge to laugh, but gave a broad grin.<br>
It'll destroy all data and play &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; on repeat.<br>
It'll drive em crazy.<br>
Yutaka held his stomach, doing his best not to laugh, and pressed his hand against his mouth.<br>
Shinji also did his best not to burst out laughing.<br>
Now they've discovered me, maybe they won't get those files.<br>
Then game will have to stop.<br>
But it hasn't.<br>
So they've only done rutine checks.<br>
I didn't go through any main files.<br>
&quot;Why don't we go find them then?&quot;<br>
&quot;Isn't that dangerous?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, but we have a gun.&quot;<br>
My plan: make them get files.<br>
Will activate virus.<br>
Shinji pulled his laptop over and showed Yutaka the document he'd been looking over.<br>
It was a 42-line text file.<br>
The data download had been interrupted, but of all the copied files this was the most important one.<br>
The horizontal text.<br>
Each row began with a listing on the left, from &quot;M01&quot; to &quot;M21,&quot; followed by &quot;F01&quot; to<br>
&quot;F21,&quot; in succession.<br>
Each listing was accompanied by a ten-digit number resembling a phone number, all in succession as well.<br>
Finally there were what appeared to be random sixteen-digit numbers.<br>
A small comma was inserted between these three listings.<br>
The file name at the heading was cryptic.<br>
&quot;guadalcanal-shiroiwa3b&quot;<br>
What's this? Yutaka wrote.<br>
Shinji nodded.<br>
These are the #'s assigned to our collars.<br>
Yutaka gave a huge nod as if to say, Oh.<br>
So &quot;M01&quot; was Male Student No.<br>
1 (Yoshio Akamatsu), and<br>
&quot;F01&quot; was Female Student No.<br>
1 (Mizuho Inada, that weird girl).<br>
Collars are like cell phones.<br>
Each band has a number and password.<br>
Use numbers to set them off.<br>
So<br>
Shinji stopped and looked at Yutaka.<br>
Then he continued If data's infected with virus we won't have to worry about collars blowing us up.<br>
Virus will keep spreading.<br>
If they have backup files they can't stop it.<br>
If they reprogram to stop virus we'll be in trouble, but it will still buy us time.<br>
&quot;How about tossing pebbles at certain places to see if someone comes running out?&quot;<br>
&quot;Wait, what if it's a girl? She might scream.<br>
That could be dangerous, not just to us, but the girl.<br>
I mean, assuming she's not 'bad.' &quot;<br>
&quot;Huh.&quot;<br>
How will you make them do it?<br>
Outside school building did you see room for SDF?<br>
Yutaka nodded.<br>
Computers in there, remember?<br>
Yutaka's eyes opened wide again as he shook his head.<br>
/<br>
couldn't afford to.<br>
Shinji chuckled a little.<br>
I got a good look.<br>
They have a row of desktop computers and large server.<br>
Someone stuck out though.<br>
It was an ensine.<br>
Or was it &quot;ensign&quot;? Forget it.<br>
He had a pin on his uniform.<br>
He was the tech.<br>
A computer runs this whole game.<br>
All we have to do is attack the school so they think we might ugh, another word I can't spell aniyulate their data.<br>
We need to get materials we can actually blow up the entire computer.<br>
So<br>
Shinji stopped writing.<br>
He spread his hands with the exaggerated motion of a magician.<br>
Then he wrote on the map BOMB THE SCHOOL ESCAPE BY SEA<br>
Yutaka's eyes were now bulging.<br>
He mouthed the word &quot;Bomb?&quot;<br>
Shinji grinned.<br>
&quot;Maybe we should look for some weapons though.<br>
That fork is pretty useless.&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh.<br>
Yeah.&quot;<br>
We need gasoline.<br>
There's a gas station at the harbor, but we can't get there.<br>
There are several cars here though.<br>
Maybe have fuel? Worst case use oil.<br>
We also need fertilizer.<br>
Yutaka knit his brows, puzzled.<br>
Fertilizer?<br>
Shinji nodded and tried to write out the name of the fertilizer compound, but he didn't know how to spell it.<br>
He was a casualty of spellcheck.<br>
Anyway, what mattered was the molecular formula.<br>
Amoniem nitrate.<br>
If we find it, we can make bomb with gasoline.<br>
Shinji pulled out his knife and the tube tied to it.<br>
He showed it to Yutaka.<br>
This is a detonater.<br>
Too complicated to explain why I have one.<br>
I just do.<br>
Yutaka looked thoughtful.<br>
Then he wrote That uncle?<br>
Shinji grinned and nodded.<br>
Yutaka knew because Shinji was always going on and on about his uncle.<br>
Yutaka wrote<br>
How are we going to bomb the school? We can't get near it.<br>
Make a giant sling with trees?<br>
Ah ha.<br>
Shinji smiled.<br>
No.<br>
Not precise enough.<br>
Too bad we don't have a bunch of bombs.<br>
But we have only one detonater, so we have only 1 chance.<br>
Rope and pulley.<br>
Yutaka opened his mouth as if to say, Oh.<br>
Can't get near school, but can go to mountain area and area on other side of school.<br>
Shinji flipped over the map and indicated the areas to Yutaka.<br>
Then he flipped it back over.<br>
Tie rope from flats to mountain.<br>
About 300 m.<br>
Stretch it tight so we can slide bomb down on puley.<br>
Then cut rope when it's on top of school.<br>
My special SLAM DUNK.<br>
Once again impressed, Yutaka nodded enthusiastically.<br>
&quot;It might be best to find weapons during the day.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, I think so too.<br>
It'll be easier than finding someone.&quot;<br>
Let's get to work.<br>
There's a pulley by a well ll saw.<br>
Get gas from cars.<br>
Fertilizer and rope? ll don't know.<br>
Can we find rope that long?<br>
They fell silent, but then Yutaka quickly wrote<br>
Let's go for it.<br>
Shinji nodded and continued<br>
We might kill Sakamochi and soldiers.<br>
But all we have to do is make them think data's damaged.<br>
Then he pointed at his neckband these can't kill us.<br>
Then escape by sea?<br>
Shinji nodded.<br>
But I can't swim he looked at Shinji warily.<br>
Shinji interrupted Yutaka's writing and wrote Full moon tonight.<br>
Use tide current.<br>
According to my calculations tide will carry us at 6-7 kph.<br>
If we swim fast it will take &lt;20 min.<br>
to reach next island.<br>
Yutaka's admiration burst beyond the expression in his eyes as he shook his head vigorously.<br>
What about guard ship?<br>
Shinji nodded.<br>
They might find us but because game's run by computers my guess is they will be lax.<br>
One ship for each direction is kinda lame.<br>
Their weakness.<br>
Once computers down they won't know where we are.<br>
Guard ship will only be able to chase us on their own.<br>
If they have satallites, cameras can't see at night.<br>
We don't have to worry about our heads blowing up.<br>
We have chance to escape.<br>
It won't be easy.<br>
I have another idea.<br>
Shinji dug into the day pack and pulled out a small transceiver.<br>
This was another item he found in someone's house.<br>
/ can increase output by customizing.<br>
Not hard.<br>
At sea I'll send out an SOS.<br>
Yutaka's face beamed.<br>
Some ship will pick us up.<br>
Shinji shook his head.<br>
No.<br>
Government will come at us so we give them false location.<br>
We escape in opposite direction.<br>
Yutaka shook his head.<br>
Then he wrote out<br>
SHINJI YOUR AWESOME<br>
Shinji shook his head and smiled.<br>
&quot;All right, then.&quot; He looked at his watch.<br>
It was already 4 p.m.<br>
&quot;We'll take off in five minutes.&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot;<br>
Shinji felt worn out from all the handwriting, which he didn't do very often.<br>
He tossed his pencil.<br>
Like a PC communication log file, the back of the map was filled with letters.<br>
(He would have preferred to communicate by laptop, but Yutaka didn't know how to type.)<br>
Then he grabbed the pencil and added<br>
Not a great plan.<br>
Our chances are slim.<br>
This is all I can think of He shrugged and looked at Yutaka.<br>
Yutaka gave him a cheerful smile and wrote Let's go for it!<br>
22 students remaining<br>
44<br>
On the southern side of the northern mountain, a boy sat on a spot on a slope covered with thick vegetation.<br>
He was looking at himself with a mirror he held in his left hand, neatly arranging his pompadour with the comb in his right.<br>
Ever since the game began he might have been the only student in class, including the girls, who felt like he could afford to take good care of his hair.<br>
But that was only natural.<br>
Although he had a thuggish-looking face, he paid an inordinate amount of attention to his personal appearance, and although no one knew exactly why, this boy was known, or no, had been known until now as &quot;Zulu,&quot; he was in any case…<br>
Queer.<br>
As for his location, he was at a horizontal distance directly two hundred meters west of where Shinji Mimura and Yutaka Seto were hiding.<br>
He was also approximately six hundred meters northwest of the medical facility where Shuya's trio was.<br>
In other words, he was right above the farmhouse where Shuya Nanahara had witnessed Kaori Minami get shot by Hirono Shimizu.<br>
If he looked up he would have had a clear view of the platform where the bodies of Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano were still lying, bathed in the light of the setting sun.<br>
This student arranging his hair had seen the corpses of Yumiko Kusaka, Yukiko Kitano, as well as that of Kaori Minami.<br>
He had actually seen more.<br>
Kaori Minami's was the seventh corpse he'd seen.<br>
Ugh, yuck.<br>
Leaves stuck in my hair again! Every time I lie down, this happens.<br>
With the pinky of his right hand, the boy brushed the blade of grass from his hair and then looked beyond his own face in the mirror to the woods approximately twenty meters below him.<br>
Ka.<br>
Zu.<br>
O.<br>
Are you asleep?<br>
The boy's thick lips twisted into a smile.<br>
Aren't you being careless? Well, even you could probably never guess that after you'd failed to kill me I'd be following you.<br>
Yes, this queer boy who was holding a mirror and comb was the only member of the &quot;Kiriyama family&quot;<br>
who'd escaped Kazuo's massacre by not showing up at the assigned meeting place.<br>
And now he, Sho Tsukioka (Male Student No.<br>
14), was the only surviving member of the Kiriyama family.<br>
In the shrubbery was Kazuo Kiriyama himself, who'd already finished off six students.<br>
For the last two hours Kazuo had remained still, though.<br>
Sho looked back at himself in the mirror, this time checking his complexion as he recalled how Mitsuru would always warn him against referring to Kazuo as &quot;Kazuo-kun.&quot; Mitsuru would say something like,<br>
&quot;Hey Sho, you have to call the boss, boss.&quot; But even bold Mitsuru seemed to have a hard time with a<br>
&quot;feminine guy,&quot; so as soon as Sho would respond with a casual sidelong glance, saying, &quot;Oh, give me a break.<br>
Don't be so picky, it's not very manly,&quot; and Mitsuru would just grimace, mumbling and letting it go at that.<br>
Call him boss, huh? Sho thought as he looked over each of his eyes in the mirror.<br>
But you ended up getting killed by that so-called boss.<br>
You're a fool.<br>
It was true.<br>
Sho Tsukioka had been more cautious than Mitsuru.<br>
It wasn't as if he had a clear sense of Kazuo the way Mitsuru had imagined right before his death, but Sho had always held the basic belief that betrayals happen all the time.<br>
That's how the world is.<br>
One could say that, compared to Mitsuru, who was just a good fighter, Sho, who'd seen more of the adult world as a result of going in and out of the gay bar his father ran ever since he was a kid, was more sophisticated.<br>
Instead of heading straight to the southern tip of the island, as Kazuo had requested, Sho moved inward from the coast, weaving his way through the woods.<br>
This ended up being a hassle, but it probably only cost him ten more minutes.<br>
He ended up seeing it all from the woods along the beach.<br>
Three bodies, two wearing coats and one in her sailor suit, sprawled on the rock stretching out into the ocean across the beach.<br>
There was Kazuo Kiriyama, standing quietly in the crevice of the rock, hidden in shadows from the moonlight.<br>
Mitsuru Numai appeared almost immediately.<br>
After a brief exchange, he was pummeled by machine gun bullets and left on the rock that was drenched with blood now (its stench even reached Sho)....<br>
Oh my, Sho thought.<br>
This is trouble.<br>
By the time he began following Kazuo Kiriyama walking away from the scene, Sho had already decided on his course of action.<br>
To assist him in this course of action, the top candidate was undoubtedly Kazuo Kiriyama.<br>
He couldn't hear what Kazuo and Mitsuru were saying to each other, but given how Kazuo had decided to play the game, he was sure Kazuo would be the best.<br>
Furthermore, at the very least, Kazuo carried not only a machine gun (was that his supplied weapon or did it belong to one of the three students he had killed?) but also Mitsuru's pistol.<br>
No one could win in a direct confrontation with Kazuo now.<br>
Sho had one advantage though, something he knew he was extremely good at.<br>
He had a talent for sneaking into places and stealing when no one was looking and was also good at following people.<br>
(When he found a boy he liked, he could stalk him endlessly.) A talent to be sneaky—what do you mean sneaky, how dare you?—in all respects.<br>
As for the weapon he found in his day pack, it was a Derringer<br>
.22 Double High Standard.<br>
The cartridge was a magnum, lethal at close range, but not the best gun for a shootout.<br>
So Sho thought, even if Kazuo Kiriyama was going to emerge victorious, he'd have to take on tough guys like Shogo Kawada and Shinji Mimura (definitely my type) who, if they had guns, would probably end up injuring him.<br>
And all that fighting should wear him out.<br>
Then…I'll just follow him until the end.<br>
At the very end I can just shoot him from behind.<br>
The moment he thinks he's finished off the last one, he'll let his guard down and that's when I'll shoot him.<br>
Even Kazuo would never suspect someone would be following him, especially me, since I blew him off last night.<br>
That way Sho wouldn't have to sully his hands in this game where you had to kill your classmates off one by one.<br>
It wasn't that he felt a strong moral objection to killing them, it was just that, he thought, I don't want to kill innocent kids, it's so vulgar.<br>
Kazuo's going to do the killing.<br>
I'm just going to stay behind him.<br>
He might be killing someone right in front of me, but it's not like I can interfere, that's too dangerous.<br>
And so at the very end, I'm going to kill him out of self-defense.<br>
I mean, if I don't kill him, he'll kill me.<br>
That was his line of thinking.<br>
There was another advantage he had in following Kazuo.<br>
If he stayed close to Kazuo, then he wouldn't have to worry much about being attacked.<br>
And on the off chance that he was, as long as he dodged the first attack Kazuo would have to respond.<br>
All Sho would have to do is flee the scene and Kazuo would take care of the rest.<br>
Of course, that would also mean losing track of Kazuo, bringing his plan to an end, so he wanted to avoid this scenario as much as possible.<br>
He decided to maintain a basic distance of twenty meters behind Kazuo.<br>
He'd move forward when Kazuo did and stop when Kazuo stopped.<br>
There was also the issue of the forbidden zones.<br>
Kazuo must have also been considering it, so he'd probably keep a good distance away from the zones.<br>
As long as Sho maintained his distance, he should be safe from entering the zones.<br>
When Kazuo stopped, he'd check the map to make sure he wasn't in a forbidden zone.<br>
Everything had proceeded according to plan.<br>
Kazuo left the southern tip of the island and after entering several houses in the residential area (probably finding what he was looking for), he decided to head to the northern mountain for some reason and then sat down.<br>
In the morning, when he heard the distant gunfire, he looked over there, but decided not to move, perhaps because of the distance.<br>
But then a little while later when Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano began calling from the peak of the mountain with their megaphone he moved quickly and after making sure no one was responding to their call (now wasn't there another gunshot? Sho believed there was, urging Yumiko and Yukiko to hide.<br>
Wow, how wonderful, so there's a real humanitarian out there.<br>
He was moved, but not enough to alter his plans) he shot them dead.<br>
Then he descended the northern slope.<br>
There was another distant gunshot, but he stayed put on this one too.<br>
Then, this just happened, just before 3 p.m.<br>
he began moving after hearing gunfire on this side of the mountain.<br>
But what he (and Sho) found at the source was the dead body of Kaori Minami, lying inside a farm equipment storage shack.<br>
Kazuo went down to check the body, probably to go through her belongings, but it looked like someone else had gotten there before them.<br>
Then he proceeded to move on—<br>
And now he's in the woods right under me.<br>
Kazuo's plan seemed simple, at least for now.<br>
Once he knew where someone was, he'd go there and shoot away.<br>
Sho was exasperated by the merciless way he'd killed Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano (Kazuo, you have such a plain name but your actions are out of control.<br>
And yet my name sounds like a celebrity's, Sho Tsukioka, but I'm just a Plain Jane), but it was pointless to fret over these details.<br>
For now he should be happy that Kazuo was completely clueless about his presence.<br>
Kazuo appeared to be resting quietly.<br>
He might have been sleeping.<br>
On the other hand Sho couldn't sleep at all, but he felt he was strong in that department as well.<br>
Naturally.<br>
Girls had more stamina than guys.<br>
That's what I read in one of those popular books.<br>
What turned out to be a real drag instead was that he was a heavy smoker.<br>
The smell of cigarette smoke, depending on the wind direction, would give him away to Kazuo.<br>
No, the sound of his electronic lighter flicking open could be even more fatal.<br>
Sho pulled out his pack of imported Virginia Slims Menthol cigarettes (he liked the name, though of course it was hard to get them in this country, but there were places that carried them, and all he had to do was steal them.<br>
He had piles of boxes in his room) and carefully placed the thin cigarette between his lips.<br>
He caught a whiff of the faint smell of tobacco leaves and that unique menthol odor and felt mild relief from his withdrawal.<br>
He wanted to fill his lungs with smoke—but somehow managed to suppress the urge.<br>
I simply cannot die.<br>
There's too much fun waiting for me in my prime.<br>
To distract himself, he lifted the mirror in his left hand and caught a view of his face with the cigarette in his mouth.<br>
He tilted his head slightly and examined his sidelong glance.<br>
I am so pretty.<br>
On top of that, I'm so smart.<br>
It's inevitable I should be the winner of this game.<br>
Only the beautiful survive.<br>
That's God's—<br>
Out of the corner of his eye, the bushes rustled slightly.<br>
Sho quickly removed the cigarette from his mouth and put it into his pocket, along with his mirror.<br>
Then he gripped the Derringer and grabbed his day pack with his left hand.<br>
Kazuo Kiriyama's slicked-back head appeared on the edge of the bushes.<br>
He looked to his left and right and then northward—directly to the left of Sho—up the slope.<br>
In the shade of the azalea tree covered in pink leaves, Sho raised his brow slightly.<br>
What's he doing?<br>
He heard no gunfire.<br>
No strange noise at all.<br>
Was there something over there?<br>
Sho looked over there, but saw no movement.<br>
Kazuo emerged from shrubs.<br>
He had his day pack on his left shoulder and the machine gun slung over his right shoulder with his hand on its grip.<br>
He began climbing the slope, weaving his way in between the trees.<br>
He quickly reached Sho's higher position and moved on up.<br>
Sho then stood up and began following him.<br>
Not at all in keeping with his large frame, 1 17 centimeters tall, Sho moved gracefully, like a cat.<br>
He carefully maintained the twenty meters behind Kazuo's black school coat that intermittently flashed between the trees.<br>
Sho's confidence was justified when it came to this sort of thing.<br>
Kazuo's movement was also very precise and quick.<br>
He'd stop in the shade of a tree, check ahead, and where the vegetation got thick, would get on his knees and check underneath before proceeding.<br>
The only trouble being that…<br>
…your back's wide open, Kazuo.<br>
They must have covered a hundred meters.<br>
The observatory was on the top left.<br>
Kazuo stopped there.<br>
The rows of trees in front of him were interrupted by a narrow, unpaved road.<br>
It was less than two meters wide, just wide enough for a car.<br>
Oh…this was the path leading up to the peak.<br>
We crossed it right before we saw Kaori Minami's body.<br>
On Kazuo's right, where he was looking, there was a space with a bench and a beige prefab toilet.<br>
Maybe it was a resting area for climbers on the way to the peak.<br>
Kazuo surveyed the area and then looked behind Sho, but Sho of course had hidden himself away in the shade.<br>
Kazuo stepped onto the path and ran up to the toilet.<br>
He opened the door and went in.<br>
He stuck his head out and looked around again before he closed the door.<br>
He left it slightly ajar, maybe just in case he had to escape if something happened.<br>
Oh my.<br>
Sho brought his hand to his lips.<br>
Oh my.<br>
Sho remained crouched, trying hard not to burst into a fit of laughter.<br>
It was true, since Sho had started following him, Kazuo hadn't gone to the bathroom even once.<br>
He might have used the toilet in one of the houses he entered before sunrise, but in any case, it'd be impossible to hold it an entire day, so Sho assumed he took care of business hidden in the bushes.<br>
(Anyway, that's what Sho did.<br>
It was a pain not to make any sound though.) But turned out he was wrong.<br>
After all, Kazuo Kiriyama came from a wealthy family.<br>
Maybe the thought of going anywhere besides a real toilet was out of the question.<br>
He must have remembered seeing this toilet when he passed through here a while ago.<br>
That's why he came back here.<br>
That's it, I'm sure.<br>
Even Kazuo Kiriyama has to pee.<br>
How cute.<br>
He was pissing against the bowl now.<br>
Sho could hear it splashing against the bowl.<br>
Tee hee.<br>
Once again Sho tried hard not to laugh.<br>
Then he remembered something and flipped his wrist over to check his watch.<br>
They were near sector D=8, which Sakamochi had announced would turn into a forbidden zone at 5 p.m.<br>
The elegant italic numerals on the women's watch indicated 4:57 p.m.<br>
(He'd set his watch to Sakamochi's announcement, so it was accurate.) Sho took out his map and examined the northern mountain area.<br>
The mountain road was only marked by a dotted line on the map, and the rest area and public toilet wasn't marked in or outside the lines marking off D=8.<br>
Sho suddenly became tense and unconsciously lifted his hand up to his metallic collar.<br>
He suddenly felt the urge to return the way he'd come but—<br>
He looked over at toilet, where the sprinkling sound continued.<br>
He shrugged and exhaled lightly.<br>
We're talking about Kazuo Kiriyama here, after all.<br>
Even if nature called, he would have checked his position.<br>
The reason why he cautiously looked over here before moving out of the bushes where he was hiding was to determine whether the toilet was in D=8 or not.<br>
And Sho's position was approximately thirty meters west of the toilet.<br>
Kazuo was closer to the zone than he was, so the fact that Kazuo was over there, in other words, meant that he was safe too.<br>
That's right.<br>
He mustn't lose Kazuo by succumbing to irrational fear.<br>
That would ruin his plan.<br>
Sho pulled out the Virginia Slims he'd taken out a moment ago and put it between his lips.<br>
Then he looked at the dimming sky.<br>
At this time of year, it'd still be another two hours before sundown, but the darkening sky was now tinged with orange from the west, and the tips of several tiny clouds had become bright orange.<br>
It was beautiful.<br>
Just like me.<br>
The sprinkling continued.<br>
Sho grinned again.<br>
You must have held it for a long time, Kazuo.<br>
It still continued.<br>
Oh, I really need a smoke.<br>
I'd like to take a shower, polish my nails, and mix my favorite screwdriver, and as I sip this drink I'd have a nice relaxing…<br>
It still went on.<br>
Oh geez, I wish he'd stop.<br>
Hey, let's wrap it up, come on and let's get to work.<br>
But…it still continued.<br>
That was when Sho finally knit his drooping, thick brows.<br>
He took the cigarette out of his mouth and quickly got up.<br>
He approached the toilet, moving along the shrubs, and squinted his eyes The sprinkling sound continued.<br>
And the door was left slightly ajar.<br>
Just then a sudden wind blew by, opening the squeaky door.<br>
What brilliant timing.<br>
Sho's eyes opened wide.<br>
Inside the toilet a government-supplied water bottle was hanging from the ceiling as it swung in the wind.<br>
Kazuo had probably pierced it with a blade because there was a very thin stream of water trickling out, fluttering with the wind.<br>
Sho panicked.<br>
Then he saw the back of a school coat below, weaving its way through the trees.<br>
He saw the unique slicked-back hairstyle which he could recognize even from behind this far away.<br>
Wh-wh-what? Kazuo? But then…hey, but I'm…<br>
As Kazuo disappeared beyond the shrubs, Sho heard a thud.<br>
It resembled the sound of a silencer, or a gunshot into a pillow.<br>
It was impossible to say whether the sound came from the bomb itself in the government's custom Program collar or from the vibration it made through his body.<br>
Over one hundred meters below, Kazuo Kiriyama didn't even look back as he glanced down at his watch.<br>
Seven seconds past five.<br>
21 students remaining<br>
45<br>
With a brief stir Noriko opened her eyes.<br>
It was past 7 p.m.<br>
She gazed at the ceiling of the room, now turned dark.<br>
Then she looked at Shuya beside her.<br>
Shuya got up a from his seat and removed the damp towel on her forehead.<br>
He touched it.<br>
Just as it was when he checked last time, her fever was almost gone.<br>
Shuya felt a wave of relief.<br>
Great.<br>
Really.<br>
&quot;Shuya.&quot; Noriko's voice was still dazed, &quot;…what time is it?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's past seven.<br>
You slept well.&quot;<br>
&quot;I…&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;Your fever's gone down.<br>
Shogo said it probably wasn't from septicemia.<br>
It was just a really bad cold.<br>
Probably from fatigue.&quot;<br>
&quot;I see...&quot; Noriko nodded slowly as if she were also relieved.<br>
Then she turned to Shuya.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry for all this trouble.&quot;<br>
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;It's not your fault at all.&quot; Then he asked, &quot;Can you eat? We have rice.&quot;<br>
Noriko's eyes opened wide.<br>
&quot;Rice?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, just hold on.<br>
Shogo cooked some.&quot; Shuya left the room.<br>
Shogo was sitting on the chair by the window by the kitchen door.<br>
The last traces of light, more like particles of blue, closer to indigo, entered the window, but where Shogo was sitting it was almost completely pitch black.<br>
&quot;Noriko's up?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;How about her fever?&quot;<br>
&quot;She's fine.<br>
It seems to be gone.&quot;<br>
Shogo gave him a slight nod, then stood up, holding the shotgun as usual.<br>
He opened the lid of the pot on the gas stove.<br>
Shuya and Shogo had already had their share of cooked rice and miso soup.<br>
The miso soup base came from some strange leaves growing in the back of the building.<br>
&quot;Is the food cold?&quot; Shuya asked.<br>
Shogo gave him a brief reply, &quot;Wait five or ten minutes.<br>
I'll bring it over.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Shuya returned to the examination room.<br>
He sat down by the bed and gave Noriko a small nod.<br>
&quot;Wait a little.<br>
Shogo's going to bring some real rice.&quot;<br>
Noriko nodded.<br>
Then she asked, &quot;Is there a bathroom here?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh…yeah.<br>
Over here.&quot;<br>
Shuya helped Noriko out of the bed.<br>
Supporting her with his arm, he showed her to the bathroom beyond the waiting room.<br>
She was still staggering, but she'd definitely recovered from the terrible condition she was in before.<br>
Shuya helped Noriko return to her bed.<br>
As Noriko sat down on the edge of the bed, Shuya wrapped her shoulders with the blanket the way Ms.<br>
Anno had done for him at the Charity House when he was a kid.<br>
&quot;Once you've eaten,&quot; Shuya said as he pulled at the edges of the blanket, &quot;I think you should get some more sleep.<br>
We're going to have to leave this place by 11 p.m.&quot;<br>
Noriko stared at Shuya.<br>
Her eyes still looked slightly unfocused.<br>
&quot;You mean—&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;Yeah, this zone's going to be forbidden at eleven.&quot;<br>
It was part of the announcement Sakamochi gave at 6 p.m.<br>
Other zones included G=ll at 7 p.m.<br>
and I=3<br>
at 9 p.m.<br>
That meant the southwest border and the southern slope of the southern mountain.<br>
Since it was hard to tell exactly where the border of the forbidden zone was, the southwest shore area was all off limits now.<br>
Noriko looked down at her kneecaps and touched her forehead under her bangs.<br>
&quot;I was sleeping like an idiot.&quot;<br>
Shuya reached out and touched Noriko on the shoulder.<br>
&quot;Don't be ridiculous.<br>
You were better off sleeping.<br>
You need to rest more.<br>
Take it easy.&quot;<br>
But Noriko glanced up and asked, &quot;Did anyone else— besides Kaori—die?&quot;<br>
Shuya tightened his lips.<br>
Then he nodded.<br>
&quot;Takako…and Sho and Kazushi.&quot;<br>
According to Sakamochi's announcement, these four had died during the six hours after twelve o'clock.<br>
Now there were only twenty-one students left.<br>
Only eighteen hours had passed since the game began, yet Third Year Class B of Shiroiwa Junior High had been reduced to half its size.<br>
&quot;And one more thing,&quot; Sakamochi had said enthusiastically.<br>
&quot;Sho Tsukioka was caught in a forbidden zone.<br>
So I want you all to be careful.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi didn't say where Sho had died, and Shuya couldn't remember hearing a big explosion in the afternoon.<br>
At the same time he couldn't see any reason Sakamochi would lie.<br>
That big, boorish-looking guy who oddly enough acted really feminine, &quot;Zuki&quot; of the Kiriyama family, had gotten himself caught in a zone.<br>
As a result, his head was blown off.<br>
Besides their boss then, the entire Kiriyama family was decimated.<br>
Shuya thought of telling Noriko about this, but after seeing how troubled she looked, he decided not to.<br>
He doubted that sharing any news about a guy's head getting blown off would have a good effect on Noriko's recovery.<br>
&quot;I see...&quot; Noriko said quietly and then added, &quot;Thanks for this,&quot; and began taking off the coat she'd been wearing.<br>
&quot;Keep it.&quot;<br>
&quot;No, I'm all right now.&quot;<br>
Shuya took the coat and draped the blanket over her shoulder again.<br>
Shogo came in after a while.<br>
Like a waiter, he carried a round tray full of bowls on one hand.<br>
Steam rose from the bowls.<br>
As he lowered the tray he said, &quot;Here you are, madame.&quot;<br>
Shuya chuckled.<br>
&quot;So she gets room service?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, the food isn't exactly first class.<br>
I hope it tastes all right though.&quot; Shogo put the entire tray on the bed and placed the bowls next to her.<br>
Noriko looked down and asked, &quot;Soup?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes ma'am,&quot; Shogo replied in English, which sounded pretty fluent to Shuya's ears.<br>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Noriko said and took the spoon.<br>
She brought the bowl to her lips and swallowed a mouthful.<br>
&quot;It's delicious.&quot; She raised her voice.<br>
&quot;There's egg in it.&quot;<br>
Shuya then looked at Shogo.<br>
&quot;It's our special, ma'am.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where'd you find that?&quot; Shuya asked.<br>
All the fresh food in the refrigerator was rotten, probably because the government had moved the civilians out a while ago.<br>
All the other houses were probably in the same condition.<br>
Shogo looked at Shuya out of the corner of his eye and grinned.<br>
&quot;I found a house that kept a hen.<br>
It looked like it hadn't been fed in a while and looked pretty weak.&quot;<br>
Shuya exaggeratedly shook his head.<br>
&quot;When we ate I didn't notice any eggs.&quot;<br>
Shogo lifted his brows.<br>
&quot;I only found one.<br>
Sorry.<br>
I'm nicer to girls.<br>
That's just how I am.&quot;<br>
Shuya laughed, sniggering.<br>
Shogo returned to the kitchen and brought over some tea.<br>
Shuya and Shogo drank tea while Noriko ate her meal.<br>
The tea had a mild sweetness and a pleasant, nostalgic odor.<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; Shuya groaned.<br>
&quot;I feel like everything's fine, the three of us sitting around like this.&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled and said, &quot;I'll make some coffee later.<br>
Would you prefer tea, Noriko?&quot;<br>
Her spoon still in her mouth, Noriko smiled and nodded.<br>
&quot;Hey, Shogo.&quot; Shuya had more to say.<br>
Of course the fact was that they were still in this killing game, but now that Noriko seemed to be recovering, he was feeling a little gushy.<br>
&quot;Some day the three of us, let's all get together for some tea.<br>
We'll sit on the veranda and enjoy the cherry blossoms.&quot;<br>
It was highly unlikely.<br>
Nonetheless Shogo shrugged his shoulders and said, &quot;I thought you were a rocker.<br>
You sound like an old man.&quot;<br>
&quot;I know.<br>
You're not the first one to tell me that.&quot;<br>
Shogo chuckled.<br>
Shuya laughed, and so did Noriko.<br>
Noriko finished her meal and said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Shogo gathered her bowls.<br>
He signaled with his other hand for Shuya's cup, which Shuya handed over.<br>
&quot;Shogo,&quot; Noriko said, &quot;I feel totally fine now.<br>
Thank you so much.<br>
And I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused.&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled and replied, &quot; You're welcome,&quot; in English.<br>
&quot;But it looks like the antibiotic wasn't necessary.&quot;<br>
&quot;No.<br>
I know this sounds weird, but I think it made me feel secure enough to fall asleep.&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled again and added, &quot;Well, you could still be suffering from septicemia.<br>
In any case, you should rest a little more.<br>
Take it easy.&quot; Shogo then said to Shuya, &quot;Do you mind if I catch some sleep?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;You tired?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, not really, but it's best to sleep when you can.<br>
Once we leave here, I'll stay up through the night.<br>
Is that all right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah sure, that's fine.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded, took the tray, and headed towards the hall.<br>
&quot;Shogo, you should sleep here,&quot; Noriko said, signaling towards the bed next to hers.<br>
Shogo glanced back at her from the door and smiled as if saying, no thank you.<br>
&quot;I don't want to intrude on you two.<br>
I'll sleep on the sofa in this room.&quot; He tilted his head in that direction and added, &quot;Please be considerate to your neighbors though if you get intimate.&quot;<br>
In the dim room Shuya could see Noriko's face flush.<br>
Shogo then left the room.<br>
Beyond the half opened door, Shuya heard him walk out of the kitchen and into the waiting room.<br>
It became quiet.<br>
Noriko broke into a smile and said, &quot;Shogo's so funny.&quot;<br>
Perhaps it was because of the meal, her face seemed more animated.<br>
&quot;Yeah, he is,&quot; Shuya smiled too.<br>
&quot;I'd never talked to him until now, but he kind of reminds me of Shinji.&quot;<br>
They didn't resemble each other at all physically, but Shogo's crude and blunt speech and his ability to still be humorous through it all resembled The Third Man.<br>
Not to mention the way he was the anti-model student and yet managed to be incredibly smart and reliable.<br>
Noriko nodded.<br>
&quot;You know you're right.<br>
Totally.&quot; Then Noriko uttered, &quot;I wonder where Shinji is.&quot;<br>
Shuya took a deep breath.<br>
He'd been wondering whether there was any way to contact him, but given Noriko's condition he couldn't afford to do anything.<br>
&quot;Yeah, if he were only with us…&quot;<br>
With Shinji along and with Shogo on their side, Shuya thought they couldn't be defeated.<br>
And if Hiroki Sugimura were with them they would be fearless and invincible.<br>
&quot;I still remember the class match,&quot; Noriko said as she glanced up at the ceiling.<br>
&quot;Not this year's, but last year's…the finals.<br>
Shinji was on his own against Class D, who had four students on the basketball team.<br>
We were thirty points behind, but then you rushed over after your softball game, and together you two guys started an incredible comeback.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Shuya nodded.<br>
He noticed how Noriko was becoming talkative.<br>
That was a good sign.<br>
&quot;I guess that's what happened.&quot;<br>
&quot;I was cheering you guys on.<br>
When we won Yukie was on her feet shrieking.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
Shuya remembered too.<br>
Because Noriko, who was always reserved, was cheering the loudest.<br>
And although he wasn't as uncoordinated as Yoshio Akamatsu, the unathletic Yoshitoki Kuninobu was standing apart from Noriko and the others.<br>
Shuya saw Yoshitoki, his hands waving and making devil signs.<br>
It was a humble gesture, but Yoshitoki's display of support moved Shuya more than Noriko and the other girls' screaming rally.<br>
Yoshitoki…<br>
Shuya gazed back at Noriko, and then realized that Noriko was crying.<br>
He reached over to Noriko, touching her shoulder, and asked, &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh…&quot; Noriko hiccuped slightly.<br>
&quot;I was telling myself not to cry, but…then I was thinking how wonderful our class was...&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
It might have been from the still lingering fever, or it might have been from the drugs, but Noriko seemed to be in an emotional state.<br>
He kept his hand on her shoulder until she stopped crying.<br>
Eventually Noriko said, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; and wiped her eyes.<br>
Then she said, &quot;I didn't tell you because it might end up disturbing you.&quot;<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
Noriko looked into Shuya's eyes.<br>
&quot;Did you know a lot of girls have a crush on you?&quot;<br>
The topic of conversation was so unexpected Shuya couldn't help grimacing.<br>
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br>
But Noriko continued, her face dead serious.<br>
&quot;Megumi…and Yukiko too, I think.&quot;<br>
Shuya tilted his head as if puzzled.<br>
Megumi Eto and Yukiko Kitano.<br>
Two of the players no longer in the running in this game.<br>
&quot;Those…&quot; Was it proper to call them &quot;those&quot;? &quot;What about those two?&quot;<br>
Noriko looked up at Shuya and said quietly, &quot;They both had a crush on you.&quot;<br>
Shuya's face stiffened.<br>
He hesitated and then mumbled, &quot;…really?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Noriko looked away from Shuya and nodded.<br>
&quot;It's easy to tell with girls.<br>
I just…wanted you to have fond thoughts for them.&quot; She added, &quot;I am in no position to be telling you this now, given the situation I'm in.&quot;<br>
Shuya had a dim image of the faces of Megumi Eto and Yukiko Kitano.<br>
Just a little though.<br>
Like, two teaspoons each.<br>
&quot;Wow…&quot; He exhaled.<br>
Then he said, &quot;I wish you'd told me after we escaped.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.<br>
Did it shock you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, a little.&quot;<br>
Noriko tilted her head again, &quot;But…I thought you should know in case I die.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked up.<br>
His right hand squeezed her left wrist.<br>
&quot;Look, please don't assume that.<br>
We're in this together till the end.<br>
We're going to survive together.&quot;<br>
Noriko was taken aback by Shuya's sudden intensity.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hm?&quot;<br>
&quot;I actually know someone who's got a crush on you.&quot;<br>
Now it was Noriko's turn to open her eyes wide.<br>
&quot;Really? Why me?&quot; She said this innocently, but the expression on her face vanished quickly.<br>
Shuya saw the fading light from the window reflected as an obscure rectangle in her pupils.<br>
She asked, &quot;Is he a classmate?&quot;<br>
Shuya slowly shook his head.<br>
As he recalled those warm, bulging eyes, he thought, damn, how nice and peaceful it would have been just to be able to get worried over a romantic triangle involving a longtime friend.<br>
But that would never happen.<br>
No siree.<br>
It just won't.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
Noriko looked somewhat relieved as she looked down at the knees of her skirt and only mumbled, &quot;I see.&quot; Then she looked up and said, &quot;So who could it be? I wasn't in any clubs or teams.<br>
And I don't have friends in any of the other classes.&quot;<br>
Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;I'm not telling.<br>
I'll tell you once we're out of here.&quot;<br>
Noriko looked slightly skeptical, but didn't pursue the matter.<br>
After they fell silent for a while Shuya looked up at the ceiling.<br>
Even though tidiness was mandatory in a clinic, the fluorescent light hanging here had dusty covers.<br>
The lights didn't work.<br>
They couldn't turn them on anyway even if they did.<br>
&quot;Megumi-san…&quot; he said.<br>
He added the polite &quot;san&quot; to her name.<br>
Boys can be so fickle, &quot;…and Yukiko-san.<br>
If it's true…what could they have possibly liked about me?&quot;<br>
It was becoming pitch black, but Noriko appeared to be smiling a little.<br>
&quot;You mind if I share my opinion?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br>
Noriko tilted her head.<br>
&quot;Everything about you.&quot;<br>
Shuya chuckled and shook his head, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's what it means to love someone.&quot; Noriko's suddenly sounded serious.<br>
&quot;Isn't that how you feel about that girl?&quot;<br>
Shuya thought of Kazumi Shintani's face.<br>
He thought about it.<br>
He hesitated, but thought he should be honest.<br>
&quot;Yeah.<br>
Something like that.&quot;<br>
&quot;If it's not, then it's not real,&quot; Noriko said as if she were amused and then let out a quiet laugh.<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm jealous.<br>
Even in this situation, it's still hard.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked at her face that was no longer discernible in the dark and hesitated whether he should tell her, but then decided he should be honest with her.<br>
&quot;I can relate to the guy who had a crush on you though.&quot;<br>
Noriko looked up at Shuya.<br>
Her well-defined brows seemed to quiver slightly.<br>
Her lips seemed to be forming a slightly melancholic smile.<br>
&quot;You're so wonderful,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
&quot;That's nice to hear even if it's not true.&quot;<br>
&quot;But it is.&quot;<br>
&quot;Can I ask you a favor?&quot;<br>
Shuya opened his eyes wide as if asking, &quot;What is it?&quot; but he wasn't sure whether Noriko could see his reaction.<br>
Noriko then leaned over slightly and gently put both of her hands on Shuya's upper arms, putting her head against his shoulder.<br>
Her shoulder-length short hair brushed up against Shuya's cheeks and ears.<br>
They remained like this for quite some time until the dimness outside the window turned into moonlight.<br>
21 students remaining<br>
46<br>
Before the dusk turned to darkness, Hirono Shimizu (Female Student No.<br>
10) emerged from the thicket she'd been hiding in and proceeded west.<br>
It was unbearable.<br>
Her body was on fire as if she were walking in a desert under a burning sun.<br>
Water.<br>
She needed water.<br>
Kaori Minami had shot her in the upper left arm.<br>
After tearing open the sleeve of her sailor suit drenched in blood, she discovered the bullet had penetrated her arm.<br>
The skin on the exit wound was torn up badly.<br>
It seemed the bullet had barely missed the major blood vessels.<br>
The torn sleeve she wrapped around her arm as a bandage seemed to have stopped the bleeding for a while.<br>
But then…the wound started to burn and the sensation spread all over her body.<br>
The initial chill was replaced by a numbing heat.<br>
By the time Sakamochi made his announcement at 6 p.m.<br>
Hirono had finished off her entire supply of water.<br>
After she killed Kaori she ran approximately two hundred meters away from Shuya and hid in the thicket, but she ended up using a lot of water in her attempt to clean her wound (which she ended up deeply regretting).<br>
Almost two hours had passed since then.<br>
For a while she'd been sweating profusely underneath her uniform, but now she wasn't sweating at all.<br>
Most likely she was approaching dehydration.<br>
In other words, unlike Noriko Nakagawa, Hirono was actually suffering from septicemia.<br>
And because she hadn't disinfected her wound, it came on quickly.<br>
Of course she had no way of knowing any of this.<br>
The only thing she knew was that she needed…water.<br>
As she cautiously moved through the green woods of the mountain, Hirono's head spun with thoughts of hatred towards Kaori Minami.<br>
Her burning body and thirst only intensified these thoughts.<br>
Hirono Shimizu had no intention of trusting anyone in this game.<br>
Of course she'd been tight with Mitsuko Souma forever, and according to student number she immediately preceded Mitsuko.<br>
So if she'd managed to avoid Hiroki Sugimura, who came in between their departures, she could have met up with Mitsuko, but she chose not to.<br>
Because she knew how terrifying Mitsuko really was.<br>
That's right…like when Mitsuko took on a bad-girl leader from another school (who'd by then become the mistress of a yakuza gangster).<br>
That girl ended up getting run over by a car.<br>
The injury was nearly fatal.<br>
Mitsuko didn't say anything about it, but Hirono knew Mitsuko had some guy do it.<br>
There were plenty of guys willing to do anything for Mitsuko___<br>
If Hirono had decided to meet up with Mitsuko, Mitsuko would have probably used her as much as possible only to finally shoot her in the back.<br>
Even though she was part of the group too, the somewhat clueless Yoshimi Yahagi might trust Mitsuko (which reminded her of how Yoshimi was dead, and Hirono had a hunch that Mitsuko was the one who killed her), but Hirono was having none of that.<br>
She couldn't imagine trusting anyone else in her class.<br>
The ones who acted nice were the ones that wouldn't think twice about killing the others now.<br>
She might have only been fifteen years old, but those fifteen years had taught her that much.<br>
At the same time though she wasn't too thrilled about killing off her classmates.<br>
She'd done prostitution and drugs, and she constantly fought with her parents who treated her like a lost cause, but murder was taboo.<br>
Of course the rules of the game permitted it, so it wasn't a crime here—but while she'd done some bad things, they were never all that harmful towards others.<br>
Even though she'd prostituted herself, compared to other girls who pretended to be proper at the same time that they &quot;phone-dated&quot; (she knew Mayumi Tendo was one of those), at least she went the whole nine yards working with professionals through her connection with Mitsuko Souma.<br>
As for drugs, what was wrong with asserting her individual freedom to choose? And it wasn't like she was putting the mall's cosmetics department out of business by stealing stuff from there.<br>
They have huge capital backing anyway___Yes, she bullied others around, but they deserved it.<br>
And as far as her fights with students from other schools, they all knew they were out to hurt each other and what they were in for.<br>
I mean, come on, grow up.<br>
In any case, she was…<br>
…not the kind of girl who'd go around murdering people.<br>
She knew that much.<br>
But, but…<br>
…it was different if she had to defend herself.<br>
And if she ended up surviving in this game…then she'd open a bottle of champagne to celebrate.<br>
Or if time ran out and she died then…her thoughts weren't very clear on this matter…anyway there was nothing she could do about that.<br>
So she ended up hiding out in that house where she later had that shootout with Kaori Minami.<br>
Once she'd checked it out and saw no one was there, she stayed there.<br>
Occasionally she'd look out the window, and once, much to her dismay, she caught a glimpse of someone in the shack across from the building where she was staying.<br>
After several minutes she decided to leave the house (she was good at leaving home).<br>
She couldn't stand the thought of someone being near her.<br>
There was no back entrance, so she climbed out the window furthest from the shack when…<br>
Kaori was looking out the door of the shack.<br>
She suddenly fired at Hirono, who'd done nothing.<br>
Kaori's shot hit Hirono's arm, and Hirono nearly rolled outside onto the ground.<br>
She somehow managed to get on her feet, and for the first time aimed her pistol and fired back.<br>
Then as she remained glued to the wall of the edge of the house…that was when Shuya Nanahara appeared.<br>
That bitch.<br>
She was always acting so innocent with her blind devotion to idol groups, and then all of a sudden she has the nerve to pull the trigger on me.<br>
Well, I was able to finish her off.<br>
(In self defense.<br>
The jury's verdict would have been 12-0, no prob.) And if the others are anything like her then I'll have to be merciless, I think.<br>
Then Hirono thought of Shuya Nanahara.<br>
At least Shuya didn't point his gun at her (which enabled her to shoot at Kaori).<br>
He also claimed he was with Noriko.<br>
Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa.<br>
Were they going out? Never seemed that way.<br>
Are they going to try to escape?<br>
Hirono automatically shook her head.<br>
Ridiculous.<br>
Nothing could be more risky than being with someone under these circumstances.<br>
If you're in a group, well then, that's just your own fault if you get shot in the back.<br>
Besides, it was impossible to escape anyway.<br>
Hirono didn't see Noriko Nakagawa, but if he was telling her the truth, then Shuya Nanahara would soon be killing Noriko Nakagawa.<br>
Or perhaps Noriko Nakagawa would be killing Shuya Nanahara.<br>
If one of them ended up surviving…then Hirono might end up having to kill one of them.<br>
But right now that didn't matter compared to her…<br>
…thirst.<br>
Before she knew it she had covered a fair distance.<br>
The dim sunlight in the western sky was gone.<br>
The sky up above was now jet black and the full moon just like last night when the game began shone eerily, casting a pale blue light on this island.<br>
She held onto the revolver that had killed Kaori Minami, a Smith &amp; Wesson Military &amp; Police .38, and ran through the bushes.<br>
She held her head low with bated breath.<br>
Then she slowly peered out of the bushes.<br>
There was a house standing beyond a narrow farm.<br>
Hirono was near the northern mountain.<br>
There was a foothill on the other side of the house.<br>
On the left there were several farms and further beyond two more similar houses.<br>
Then the land sloped upward to the southern mountain.<br>
According to the map, in front of that mountain there was supposed to be a relatively wide longitudinal road that traversed the island.<br>
So given the position of the mountains Hirono was probably near the island's western shore.<br>
Just as she had done before moving, she checked her position and was pretty certain she wasn't in a forbidden zone.<br>
Hirono did her best to forget about her thirst and observed the house in front.<br>
The area was completely still and silent.<br>
She remained crouched and crossed the farm.<br>
The area around the house seemed slightly elevated above the farm.<br>
Hirono stopped at the edge of the farm and after looking back she observed the house again.<br>
It was your average, old, single-story farmhouse.<br>
But unlike the previous house she'd hid inside, the roof was tiled.<br>
An unpaved road came in from the left side of the farm.<br>
There was a light truck parked in front of the house.<br>
She also saw a moped and bicycle.<br>
The water at the first house Hirono hid in wasn't running.<br>
This one was probably no different.<br>
Hirono looked to her right and left…<br>
…and found a well at the far end of the area from the entrance road.<br>
It even had a beam holding a bucket.<br>
There were thin tangerine trees with plenty of leaves surrounding the well.<br>
Their branches were high, so she could tell there was no one hiding under the trees.<br>
Since she couldn't use her left hand, she tucked her gun in the front.<br>
Then she groped around the farm soil under the moonlight.<br>
She found a fist-sized rock.<br>
She tossed it upward.<br>
Tracing an arc, the rock crashed against the roof.<br>
It rattled down the rows of tiles and fell off the edge onto the ground with a thud.<br>
Hirono gripped the gun and waited.<br>
She checked her watch.<br>
Then she waited again.<br>
Five minutes passed.<br>
No one appeared at the windows or entrance.<br>
Hirono quickly stepped up to the property and ran toward the well.<br>
Her head was spinning from thirst and fever.<br>
The well was a concrete tube approximately eighty centimeters high.<br>
Hirono clutched the brim of the well.<br>
Inside it, the moonlight revealed a small circle six to seven meters down.<br>
Her own shadow was also reflected inside the circle.<br>
It was water.<br>
Ah, it wasn't dry.<br>
Once again Hirono tucked her revolver into her skirt and removed her day pack from her aching left shoulder with her right hand.<br>
It landed on the dirt.<br>
Then she held the worn out rope hanging from the bucket beam.<br>
As she pulled the rope, a small bucket appeared on the surface of the water.<br>
Hirono frantically tugged at the rope.<br>
The bucket beam was equipped with what looked like an ancient pulley which allowed you to retrieve water with two buckets.<br>
Her left arm was too numb to move, but with every pull she held the rope against the concrete edge of the well with her elbow and managed to pull the bucket upward.<br>
The bucket finally reached the edge of the well.<br>
She held the rope with her elbow once more, grabbed the handle of the bucket, and placed it on the edge of the well.<br>
It was water.<br>
The bucket was brimming with water.<br>
She didn't care if it ended up making her sick.<br>
Her body needed water now.<br>
But then she discovered something and let out a small shriek.<br>
There was a tiny fingernail-sized frog swimming in the water.<br>
In the moonlight she saw its small, gross eyes and its glistening back.<br>
(In broad daylight, their color would have been an disgusting fluorescent green, or a dirty brown.) It was her least favorite animal, and the mere sight of one with its slimy skin was enough to send chills down her spine.<br>
But Hirono did her best to quell her disgust.<br>
She didn't have the strength to pull the bucket up again.<br>
Her thirst was unbearable now.<br>
She would have to get rid of that frog, and then—<br>
The frog climbed onto the edge of the bucket and leapt onto Hirono.<br>
Hirono let out a small shriek and twisted her body.<br>
So what if this was a matter of life or death.<br>
She just couldn't stand frogs.<br>
She somehow managed to dodge the frog—but her right hand let go of the bucket, which suddenly fell back into the well with a splash—and that was that.<br>
Hirono groaned and looked over in the direction of the frog.<br>
I'll kill it.<br>
I'll kill that fucking frog!<br>
But then…something else caught her eye.<br>
She saw a black figure in a student coat stop a mere four or five meters in front of her.<br>
Hirono's back had been facing the house.<br>
Now she saw the back door behind the figure was ajar.<br>
With the figure frozen in its footsteps, Hirono suddenly recalled a childhood memory—the game where you have to freeze when the person who was &quot;it&quot; turns around—but that was irrelevant.<br>
The issue at stake was that this thin, short, ugly boy—come to think of it, he also resembled a frog—Toshinori Oda (Male Student No.<br>
4) was holding a thin, ribbonlike object with both hands.<br>
Hirono realized it was a belt.<br>
Now look at this.<br>
Toshinori Oda, the privileged son of a company president whose house was located in the town's wealthy district.<br>
He was supposed to be good at violin (apparently he'd won some competition).<br>
A pretentious, well bred, quiet boy.<br>
And this kid was now…<br>
… trying to kill me!<br>
As if the pause on a frozen video image had been suddenly released, Toshinori moved, swung his belt up, and attacked her.<br>
The large buckle sparkled in the moonlight.<br>
It could easily gouge out some flesh on impact.<br>
The distance between them was only four meters...<br>
Enough.<br>
Hirono's right hand went for her gun.<br>
She felt the grip, by now a familiar sensation.<br>
Toshinori was right in front of her.<br>
She fired.<br>
She fired three times in a row.<br>
All the shots landed in his stomach.<br>
She saw his school coat instantaneously rip apart.<br>
Toshinori spun around and fell face forward.<br>
Dust flew up into the air and he remained motionless.<br>
Hirono tucked the revolver into her skirt again.<br>
The hot barrel burned against her stomach, but she couldn't be concerned about that.<br>
Right now the important thing was… water.<br>
She picked up her day pack and entered the house.<br>
She'd been foolish exposing her back to the house, but now she no longer had to make sure it was unoccupied.<br>
And she could drink Toshinori's water.<br>
She deliberated over whether to use her flashlight, but Toshinori's day pack turned out to be located right behind the back door.<br>
Hirono crouched down and opened the zipper with her right hand.<br>
There were water bottles.<br>
One of them hadn't been opened and the other was still half full.<br>
She felt a wave of relief.<br>
Still on her knees, Hirono opened the lid of the half filled bottle and pressed her lips against it, sucking on it as she tilted the bottle back.<br>
Hmm.<br>
Was this an indirect kiss with the boy who had tried to kill her—who was, on top of that, dead? Didn't matter.<br>
Concerns like that were now as remote as the tropics or the north pole.<br>
Or the moon.<br>
This is Armstrong.<br>
One small step for a man…<br>
She guzzled the water down.<br>
It was delicious.<br>
No doubt about that.<br>
Water never tasted this good.<br>
Even though the water was lukewarm, as it gushed down her throat and into her stomach it felt like ice water.<br>
It was so good.<br>
She emptied the bottle almost immediately.<br>
She took a deep breath.<br>
Something wrapped around her throat.<br>
Right above the metal collar.<br>
She went into a coughing fit and a mist of water sprayed out between her lips.<br>
As she struggled with her functioning right hand to free herself from the object digging in under her throat, she twisted her head around.<br>
Immediately to the right of her face she saw the boy's tense face…which belonged to Toshinori Oda, the boy who just died!<br>
Her throat was getting choked.<br>
It took her several seconds to realize what was wrapped around her neck.<br>
It was Toshinori's belt.<br>
How how how—how could this guy be alive?<br>
The dark interior of the house was fading into red.<br>
She tried to pry the belt loose with her right hand as her fingernails tore off.<br>
Blood dripped out of her fingers.<br>
That's right, my gun.<br>
Hirono reached for her gun tucked in the front of her skirt.<br>
But her arm was kicked by the foot of an expensive leather shoe, making a cracking sound.<br>
Along with her left arm, her right one went numb too.<br>
The belt slackened for a moment—but then it tightened again.<br>
She couldn't hold the belt anymore and instead she swung her twisted arm around in a bizarre looking manner.<br>
It was only a matter of seconds.<br>
Her arm hung limply.<br>
Although she wasn't in the same rank as Takako Chigusa or Mitsuko Souma, she was still quite attractive and she had the appealing, mature look of a high school or college student.<br>
But now her face was puffed up from blood congestion, and her tongue was now twice its normal size and hung out from the middle of her mouth.<br>
Nonetheless, Toshinori Oda continued choking Hirono's throat.<br>
(Of course he didn't forget to check around occasionally.)<br>
After five minutes or so, Toshinori finally released the belt from Hirono's neck.<br>
The breathless Hirono fell forward onto the raised floor.<br>
There was a muffled cracking sound.<br>
Maybe part of Hirono's face had cracked.<br>
Her punkish hair that stood straight up was now going in all directions and fading into the darkness.<br>
The nape of her neck above the collar of her sailor suit and her left arm with the torn sleeve were the only parts glimmering white.<br>
Toshinori Oda breathed heavily for a while as he stood still in a daze.<br>
His stomach was still in pain, but it wasn't too bad now.<br>
When he first opened his day pack he had no idea what this cumbersome strange gray vest was, but it did exactly what the manual said it would.<br>
Amazing…<br>
…what a bulletproof vest can do.<br>
20 students remaining<br>
47<br>
The area was pitch black by now, but thanks to the nearly full moon, the cliff extending from the foot of the northern mountain offered a wide open view of the ocean.<br>
The Seto Inland Sea Islands floated in the black sea, but there were absolutely no ship lights nearby due to the governments prohibition on traffic in the area.<br>
The guard ships were also out of sight, probably because they were moored with their lights off.<br>
He'd seen this view before, but from a lower position.<br>
That's right, when he left the school building.<br>
Of course, this was neither the time nor place to call it a nice view.<br>
&quot;All right then, over here,&quot; Shinji said.<br>
He tucked his gun into his belt, and was the first to climb up on the rock.<br>
Then he offered his hand to Yutaka.<br>
Yutaka was out of breath due to the climb up the mountain as well as from the looming threat of being attacked in the dark, but he managed to grip onto Shinji's hand and struggled up the rock.<br>
They stayed flat on their stomachs and looked down the cliff The blackened rows of woods spread out beneath them, and further beyond there was a glimmer of light.<br>
It came from the school building where Sakamochi was.<br>
It hardly emitted any light because the windows had been sealed off with those steel sheets.<br>
It was approximately one hundred meters away.<br>
The school's sector, G=7, was already forbidden, so they'd immediately get killed if they entered it, but they were a safe distance away now.<br>
By using cross-bearing navigation with his compass and map before the sun went down, Shinji managed to figure out precisely the zone layout.<br>
The school, in sector G=7, was nearer the border of F=7, where Shinji and Yutaka were now, and according to the map the shortest distance to the border was approximately eighty meters.<br>
Furthermore, with the 6 p.m.<br>
announcement of forbidden zones, neither F=7 nor H=7, which surrounded the school, were included.<br>
Which reminded him of Sakamochi's announcement that Sho Tsukioka had gotten caught in a forbidden zone.<br>
He was an annoying, queer kid (&quot;Shinji, let's go out on a date&quot;), and right now Shinji really couldn't be bothered by others, but he felt a little sorry for Sho whose head had probably been blown off by a bomb.<br>
He wondered where it happened.<br>
He also felt a pang of remorse over the death of Takako Chigusa.<br>
She was the prettiest girl in the class (according to Shinji's taste, anyway), and what's more, she was childhood friends with Hiroki Sugimura.<br>
Contrary to what most of the class thought—that they were a couple—Hiroki and Takako weren't going out (Hiroki himself told Shinji).<br>
Still, it must have come as a shock to Hiroki.<br>
Hiroki—where the hell are you?<br>
Shinji decided to concentrate on the present.<br>
He observed the school below and its surrounding geography closely.<br>
They would have to stretch a rope from here, over the school, and then over to the other side of the zone.<br>
Now that he actually had a view of the area, he realized how much distance they'd have to cover.<br>
Gazing at the gentle light leaking out the steel-plated windows, Shinji thought, damn.<br>
That was where Sakamochi and his men were.<br>
It was dinner time.<br>
For all he knew they could be eating fried udon.<br>
(He thought of fried udon because it was his favorite ever since his uncle made it several times for him when he had him over at his small single-bedroom house and that was what Shinji wanted so badly to eat right now.) Bastards.<br>
Shinji and Yutaka already had what they needed.<br>
Although it wasn't indicated on the map (which marked it as just another blue dot), Shinji managed to find a farm coop near the longitudinal road slightly south of the school.<br>
The building with slated roof and walls bore a sign that read<br>
&quot;Northern Takamatsu Agricultural Cooperative Association, Okishima Island Branch.&quot; (Although Shinji already knew they were on Okishima Island in the Takamatsu-shi Sound, Yutaka was impressed.) It wasn't your typical farm coop.<br>
It had no real office, nor were there any ATMs.<br>
There was only a tractor, combine harvester, and threshing machine scattered inside the warehouse-like space.<br>
The only other equipment they found was an office desk taking up one of the corners.<br>
Anyway, that was where they found the ammonium nitrate.<br>
Fortunately it was fresh, not at all damp.<br>
On top of that, they didn't have to collect gas from cars.<br>
They found plenty in the gas containers.<br>
The pulley they took from the well next to the house where Shinji had found the Macintosh PowerBook 150, slightly east of the coop.<br>
The other significant item was rope.<br>
If they were going to stretch rope across sector G=7 they would need at least three hundred meters of it.<br>
Furthermore, they would have to roll it out with plenty of slack to escape detection by Sakamochi and his men so they needed even more.<br>
It wasn't going to be easy finding rope that long.<br>
The farm coop had rope but all together it was at most two hundred meters long and— maybe it was used for a greenhouse or something—too thin at a diameter of less than three millimeters to be reliable.<br>
Fortunately though, they managed to find what appeared to be a private fishing-equipment warehouse along the shore south from the harbor, which was now forbidden along with the residential area.<br>
In spite of the fishing rope being weathered out from exposure, in spite of its heavy weight and size, given how it was over three hundred meters long, Shinji and Yutaka managed to divide it up, transport it, and hide it in the farm coop.<br>
Leaving these resources behind, they came up here.<br>
Shinji stared into the dark.<br>
The foot of the northern mountain, where they were now, spread out around this side of the school, in other words, the north side, and his right, the west side.<br>
To the left of the school, the woods on the east extended up to the northern side of the residential area and the seashore.<br>
Beyond the school there were paddy fields.<br>
There were clusters of trees here and there, and between them he could see some houses.<br>
Beyond the houses, Shinji could barely make out the farm coop warehouse where they had left all their equipment.<br>
Immediately to the left the area became gradually crowded with rows of roofs that extended over the border of the forbidden zone into the residential area.<br>
Yutaka tapped him on the shoulder.<br>
Shinji looked to Yutaka, who was on his right.<br>
Yutaka pulled out his student notepad and began writing something.<br>
That's right, before they started moving, Shinji had warned Yutaka with another message that they mustn't give anything away by talking.<br>
After all, if Sakamochi and his men found out they were up to no good again, this time Shinji was sure they wouldn't hesitate to blow their heads off by remote control.<br>
He'd already gone over why Sakamochi chose not to ignite Shinji and Yutaka's collars.<br>
It was probably because it was best for the game if the students fought each other as much as possible.<br>
Shinji had some theories about this.<br>
It had to do with a rumor he'd heard that high-ranking government officials placed bets on this game.<br>
If that was true, then he was sure the star shooting guard of Shiroiwa Junior High, The Third Man, must have been the top seed.<br>
All the more reason why Sakamochi couldn't just finish him off.<br>
That was Shinji's hypothesis.<br>
Meanwhile Yoshitoki Kuninobu and Fumiyo Fujiyoshi were irrelevant players.<br>
Or, to be blunt, no one had placed any bets on them.<br>
Still, even if that were true (what a bastard that &quot;Kinpati Sakamocho&quot; was), as long as Sakamochi was in charge of this game, he could blow their heads off at any time.<br>
Shinji could only pray that wouldn't happen until they managed to bomb the school.<br>
Of course Shinji found the idea despicable.<br>
The thought of someone else having so much control over him was entirely revolting to Shinji, who learned from his uncle how to be totally self-reliant for everything in his life.<br>
As he looked down at the light from the school though, he shook his head.<br>
That was neither here nor there.<br>
He recalled his uncle once telling him, &quot;Don't worry about stuff you can't do anything about.<br>
You do what you can even if your chances of success are less than one percent.&quot;<br>
Yutaka seemed done writing his message and tapped his shoulder.<br>
Shinji turned away from the view and examined the note under the moonlight.<br>
There's no way we can toss that enormous rope over there.<br>
Besides we left the rope behind.<br>
What are we going to do?<br>
That's right.<br>
He hadn't explained that yet.<br>
They'd been too frantic in their search for the equipment.<br>
Shinji nodded, took out his pencil, and wrote on the student notepad Wire.<br>
I brought some.<br>
We'll reel out the wire down to the other side and tie it to the rope.<br>
Then we'll draw in the rope by pulling the wire right before we execute our plan.<br>
He handed the pad over to Yutaka.<br>
After reading the note, he looked at Shinji and nodded, as if satisfied.<br>
Then he wrote You're going to tie a rock to the wire and throw it over there?<br>
Shinji shook his head.<br>
Yutaka opened his eyes, surprised.<br>
Then after some thought he wrote again Are you going to make a bow and arrow and shoot the wire across?<br>
Shinji shook his head again.<br>
He took the pad and began scribbling That might work.<br>
But even I can't throw a rock 300m away.<br>
And I can't afford to miss.<br>
If the rock hits the school we're done.<br>
And if the wire gets caught somewhere and we end up breaking it…I have a better plan.<br>
Yutaka didn't take up his pencil this time and only gazed back at Shinji as if saying, &quot;?&quot; Shinji took the pad and continued First, tie the wire to a tree here.<br>
Then go down the mountain with the other end of wire.<br>
Stretch it taut when we're on the other side.<br>
Yutaka read this but then almost immediately knit his brows skeptically.<br>
He wrote quickly, You can't do that his note read It'll get caught in the trees.<br>
Somewhere in the middle.<br>
Shinji grinned.<br>
He couldn't blame Yutaka for doubting him.<br>
The path they'd taken here was covered with trees, both large and small.<br>
Even if they managed to drag the wire out while avoiding G=7 and tugged on it later, the wire might get caught.<br>
It would make for an odd-looking piece of outdoor contemporary art.<br>
&quot;This installation piece is gigantic, but five meters away it turns obscure.<br>
The piece addresses the delicate balance between nature and humans...&quot; On top of that, sector G=7 was filled with dense forestry bordering up to the school.<br>
Unless you were a 100-meter-tall giant (wasn't there a video his uncle had shown him, an old special-effects movie where the superhero saves the world by fighting against monsters as they completely tear up the city? They don't make movies like that anymore) you'd have to cut down all the trees if you wanted to put the wire near the school.<br>
It was so obvious.<br>
And that was why Yutaka insisted it was impossible.<br>
But Shinji elegantly spread his arms out (given how they were on their stomachs though, the effect wasn't so impressive) and wrote How about launching an ad balloon, huh, Yutaka' ?<br>
Yutaka read the note and knit his brows.<br>
Shinji signaled Yutaka to get off the cliff rock and follow him.<br>
Once they sat under the rock, he rummaged through his day pack.<br>
He pulled out the contents and lined them up on the ground.<br>
A half dozen gas canisters, several hundred-meter reels of thin fishing wire (that was all he found at the farm coop), plastic tape, and a box of black plastic garbage bags.<br>
Shinji took one of the canisters and showed it to Yutaka.<br>
It was painted blue with bright red letters which read &quot;VOICE CHANGER&quot; (underneath the ad copy read, &quot;Now you'll be the life of the party!&quot; huh!), and under that there was an illustration of a duck—Shinji recognized where it came from—based on a<br>
&quot;Walt Disney&quot; character.<br>
A whistlelike object poked out of the canister.<br>
Shinji wrote I remembered seeing these at the house where I found the PowerBook.<br>
You know what this is?<br>
Before taking the pulley, Shinji had gone into the nearby house to retrieve these canisters.<br>
What in the world would the occupant of that house do with all these things, though? The files left on the PowerBook's hard drive offered a clue.<br>
Given how they had names like &quot;5th Grade Science&quot; or &quot;Third Term Report Card Drafts,&quot; the owner of the machine must have been an elementary school teacher.<br>
Yes, he was probably one of the real teachers at that school.<br>
Yutaka touched his throat and opened his mouth.<br>
Shinji nodded.<br>
Right.<br>
It makes you sound like a duck! It's helium.<br>
And this one's a defect.<br>
So it's still loaded with gas.<br>
Yutaka still seemed unconvinced.<br>
Shinji thought an actual demonstration would get his point across quicker so he tore open the pack of garbage bags and pulled out a bag.<br>
He opened it up, inserted the canister valve (which was supposed to be sucked) into it, and taped it to the bag with the plastic tape.<br>
He sealed the edge of the bag with more tape.<br>
Then he pressed the valve button and the bag began to inflate.<br>
With his finger on the button, Shinji thought, this would be a lot more entertaining with condoms.<br>
But even if they had condoms they would have been a little too small.<br>
Huh?<br>
Do I have some on me? Well, I mean, come on, this was supposed to be a study trip.<br>
Anything can happen, right? You tossed your clothes, but you're still holding onto these? Yeah, I dunno, I do still have them.<br>
Well, you never know when they might come in handy.<br>
Let's not go into details.<br>
After filling up the bag, Shinji twisted the edge right above the canister and sealed it with tape.<br>
He took a reel of fishing wire and tied its end to the end of the bag.<br>
Then he removed the tape below to release it from the canister.<br>
Just to be sure, he folded the edge over again, sealing it again with more tape.<br>
The garbage bag floated upward.<br>
It rose until the wire was taut to the point where it almost seemed to lift the reel—but it stopped right at Shinji and Yutaka's heads.<br>
&quot;See?&quot; Shinji said out loud.<br>
Yutaka had probably realized what was going on while Shinji was working on the canister.<br>
He'd already nodded several times.<br>
Shinji tied another piece of wire from another reel to the wire stretching under the balloon.<br>
Just to be sure, he secured this to the balloon with tape.<br>
With the pair of wires in both of his hands, he moved the balloon as if it were walking on a pair of legs.<br>
Then he pointed to a nearby tree.<br>
He moved the string.<br>
Yes, in other words, these were the legs of the giant.<br>
They were too frail to crush a city and right now they're shorter than me, but…<br>
Yutaka seemed to understand completely.<br>
He gave two huge nods.<br>
Then he moved his lips without saying anything.<br>
It looked like he was saying, &quot;Awesome, Shinji.&quot; Or maybe it was, &quot;Enough already.&quot;<br>
Whatever, it didn't matter.<br>
Shinji took the memo pad and wrote, We make one or two more balloons and attach them to each other.<br>
But I still don't know how far up the wire can be stretched.<br>
There's also the wind.<br>
Let's just go for it.<br>
Yutaka read this and nodded.<br>
Shinji glanced up at the sky.<br>
The bags were black, so even under the moon, Sakamochi and his men wouldn't see them.<br>
Right now there wasn't much wind either.<br>
But he had no idea what it was like further up there in the sky.<br>
Then he said, &quot;Let's hurry.&quot;<br>
Shinji signaled Yutaka to hold onto the first balloon and proceeded to pull out another garbage bag.<br>
20 students remaining<br>
48<br>
Shogo rose a little after 10 p.m.<br>
Shuya had been looking after Noriko, who remained resting in bed.<br>
Shuya groped through the nearly pitch black room and entered the waiting room.<br>
&quot;I'll make some coffee,&quot; Shogo said as he looked up at Shuya.<br>
Then he walked down the hall.<br>
He seemed to have good night vision.<br>
Shuya returned to the beds, where he found Noriko up without her blanket.<br>
&quot;You should rest a little more,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
Noriko nodded, &quot;Uh huh…&quot; Then she mumbled, &quot;Could you ask Shogo…if he's going to boil some more water if I can get an extra cup?&quot; Noriko was sitting on the edge of the bed with her hands by her thighs.<br>
Moonlight spilled in over the curtain from the window.<br>
She kept her chin tucked in as she looked over to her side.<br>
&quot;Sure…but what for?&quot;<br>
Noriko hesitated and then answered, &quot;I sweated so much…I just wanted to wipe my body…maybe it's too much to ask for.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Shuya replied and quickly nodded.<br>
&quot;No prob.<br>
I'll go tell him.&quot; He left the room.<br>
Shogo was boiling water in the dark kitchen.<br>
The tip of the cigarette between his mouth glowed red, and the charcoal flame under the pot resembled a strange firefly stirring to life.<br>
&quot;Shogo,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
Shogo turned around.<br>
The afterimage of his cigarette traced a thick line before vanishing.<br>
&quot;Noriko was wondering if she could have some hot water.<br>
She said one cup was enough—&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah.&quot; Shogo didn't let him continue.<br>
He removed his cigarette from his mouth.<br>
Shuya could see Shogo was smiling in the dim moonlight coming through the window.<br>
&quot;Sure.<br>
A cup or an entire bucket, fine with me.&quot;<br>
As he moved he scooped up water with the bowl from the bucket and added it to the pot.<br>
He repeated this five times.<br>
He kept a low charcoal flame going to keep the water in the pot boiling.<br>
Shuya felt some steam drift by.<br>
&quot;She's a girl,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
It turned out Shogo wasn't as slow as Shuya was.<br>
He knew why Noriko asked for hot water.<br>
Shuya was silent and Shogo unexpectedly continued on his own.<br>
&quot;She wants to stay pretty cause she's with you.&quot;<br>
Then he exhaled some smoke.<br>
Shuya remained quiet, but then asked, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Shogo seemed to be shaking his head.<br>
Squinting his eyes, Shuya could see three cups and a coffee dripper already loaded with a filter on the table.<br>
There was also a tea bag for Noriko.<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; Shogo called him.<br>
Shuya lifted his brow, &quot;What is it? All of a sudden you're so chatty.&quot;<br>
Shogo chuckled.<br>
Then he continued, &quot;I understand how you feel about Yoshitoki, but don't forget about Noriko's feelings.&quot;<br>
Shuya fell silent again.<br>
The he spoke.<br>
For some reason, there was a hint of dissatisfaction in his tone of voice.<br>
&quot;I know.&quot;<br>
&quot;You have a girlfriend?&quot; Shogo proceeded to ask.<br>
Shuya shrugged.<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then what's the problem?&quot;<br>
Shogo continued to look at the window, smoking his cigarette.<br>
&quot;It's not a bad thing to be loved.&quot;<br>
Shuya shrugged again.<br>
Then he asked, &quot;Don't you have someone?&quot;<br>
His cigarette glowed brightly.<br>
He didn't say anything.<br>
The smoke drifted slowly through the dark.<br>
&quot;A secret, huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;No…&quot; Shogo began to speak, but then he removed the cigarette from his mouth and tossed it into the bucket of water.<br>
&quot;Get down, Shuya,&quot; he whispered and crouched down.<br>
Shuya nervously obeyed him.<br>
Was someone going to attack? He grew tense.<br>
&quot;Get Noriko.<br>
Be quiet though,&quot; Shogo whispered again.<br>
Shuya was already on his way to the examination room, where Noriko was.<br>
Noriko was still sitting in a daze on the edge of the bed.<br>
Shuya signaled her to duck down.<br>
She must have immediately understood because she got off the bed, holding her breath.<br>
Shuya offered her his hand for support as they moved to the kitchen.<br>
He looked over to the entrance on the way there, but there was no one beyond the glass door.<br>
Shogo had already gathered their day packs which he'd packed with refilled water bottles and other items, and now he was on his knees by the back door, holding his shotgun.<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; Shuya asked in a hushed voice.<br>
Shogo lifted his left hand to silence him.<br>
Shuya didn't say another word.<br>
&quot;Someone's outside,&quot; Shogo whispered.<br>
&quot;We'll exit through whichever door they don't enter.&quot;<br>
The only thing visible in the dark was the bright charcoal flame under the pot.<br>
Given the location of the sink, it couldn't be seen from outside.<br>
Shuya heard a tapping sound.<br>
It came from the entrance.<br>
The door wouldn't open because of the stick jamming it.<br>
The glass was broken, so the person outside must have realized that someone had entered the building and that it was probably still occupied.<br>
There was a clacking sound, but then it stopped.<br>
It sounded like the person had given up.<br>
Shogo groaned.<br>
&quot;Damn, we'll be in trouble if this one tries to set this place on fire.&quot;<br>
They remained quiet, but there was still no sound.<br>
Then Shogo signaled for them to move towards the entrance.<br>
He might have heard a slight sound.<br>
They were nearly crawling down the hall.<br>
As they made their way, Shogo, behind the other two, reached out to Shuya who was leading.<br>
They stopped.<br>
Shuya turned around and looked over his shoulder at Shogo.<br>
&quot;He's circling back to the front.&quot; He waved his hand to the back.<br>
&quot;Let's go out the back.&quot;<br>
So they went towards the kitchen down the hall.<br>
Shogo stopped again before they entered the kitchen.<br>
&quot;Damn, why?&quot; he muttered.<br>
…the person outside was now coming round to the back door again.<br>
The silence continued.<br>
Shogo held onto his shotgun.<br>
With Noriko between him and Shogo, Shuya also gripped the SIG-Sauer that had once belonged to Kaori Minami.<br>
(He'd given the Smith &amp; Wesson to Shogo.<br>
Shuya decided to hold onto the gun that had more bullets.) But the silence was suddenly broken.<br>
A voice called from outside the kitchen window.<br>
&quot;It's Hiroki,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;I'm not fighting.<br>
Respond, you three.<br>
Who are you?&quot;<br>
It was undoubtedly the voice of Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No.<br>
11), who along with Shinji Mimura was one of the few classmates Shuya could trust.<br>
&quot;What the?…&quot; Shuya moaned.<br>
&quot;That's incredible...&quot;<br>
It was a stroke of luck.<br>
He never thought they'd see Hiroki.<br>
Shuya and Noriko looked at each other.<br>
Noriko looked relieved.<br>
Shogo stopped Shuya as he tried to get up.<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;Shh.<br>
Don't raise your voice.&quot;<br>
Shuya stared at Shogo's serious expression and then responded with an exaggerated shrug and smiled.<br>
&quot;Don't worry.<br>
I'll vouch for him.<br>
We can totally trust him.&quot;<br>
Shogo shook his head and said, &quot;How did he know there were three of us?&quot;<br>
That thought hadn't occurred to Shuya.<br>
He thought it over while looking at Shogo.<br>
But he had no idea.<br>
That didn't matter though.<br>
The important thing was that Hiroki was here.<br>
He just wanted to see Hiroki's face now.<br>
&quot;Maybe he saw us go in here, from far away.<br>
That's why he didn't know who we were.&quot;<br>
&quot;What took him so long to get here then?&quot;<br>
Shuya thought again.<br>
&quot;He probably deliberated over whether he should find out who was here or not__In any case, we can trust Hiroki.<br>
I'll vouch for him.&quot;<br>
Shuya ignored Shogo, who looked like he wasn't satisfied.<br>
He raised his voice and directed it beyond the window.<br>
&quot;It's Shuya, Hiroki.<br>
I'm with Shogo Kawada and Noriko Nakagawa.&quot;<br>
&quot;Shuya!…&quot; a relieved voice replied.<br>
&quot;Let me in.<br>
Where should I come in?&quot;<br>
Before Shuya could answer, Shogo raised his voice, &quot;This is Shogo.<br>
Go to the front entrance.<br>
Keep your hands behind your head and do not move.<br>
Got that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Shogo…&quot; Shuya was about to protest, but Hiroki immediately responded, &quot;Got it.&quot; What looked like the upper body of Hiroki crossed the frosted glass window.<br>
Shogo bent down to look out of the cracks in the glass.<br>
Holding onto his shotgun, he yanked out the obstructing stick and opened the door.<br>
Hiroki Sugimura was standing with his hands behind his neck.<br>
He was slightly taller than Shogo, but more slender.<br>
His hair, wavy like Shuya's, went down the middle of his forehead.<br>
His day pack was by his feet and for some reason there was a 1.5-meter stick on the ground.<br>
It was true.<br>
Shuya shifted his eyes, as if it were a miracle.<br>
Shuya's face made Hiroki grin.<br>
&quot;I have to do a body check.&quot;<br>
&quot;Shogo, come on…&quot;<br>
Shogo paid no attention to Shuya's protest and moved forward, holding onto his shotgun.<br>
He went behind Hiroki and first checked his hands behind his neck.<br>
Then he rubbed his left hand over Hiroki's school coat.<br>
His hand stopped at a pocket.<br>
&quot;What the hell's this?&quot;<br>
&quot;Go ahead and pull it out,&quot; Hiroki said with his hands held together.<br>
&quot;But give it back to me.&quot;<br>
Shogo pulled it out.<br>
It was the size and shape of a thick notepad, but it was made of plastic or steel.<br>
The cover panel reflected the moonlight.<br>
After fiddling around with it, Shogo said, &quot;Ah ha.&quot; He moved his body with the object in his hands and then looked down at the cover panel against the moonlight.<br>
He nodded and returned it to Hiroki's pocket.<br>
Then he thoroughly searched Hiroki down to his pant cuffs.<br>
He also checked his day pack and finally announced, &quot;Okay.<br>
Sorry about that.<br>
You can put your hands down.&quot;<br>
Hiroki unlocked his hands and picked up his day pack and stick.<br>
The stick appeared to be his weapon.<br>
&quot;Hiroki.&quot; Shuya broke into a smile.<br>
&quot;Come on in.<br>
We have coffee.<br>
You want some?&quot;<br>
Hiroki nodded somewhat hesitantly as he went through the entrance.<br>
Shogo looked outside and then shut the door.<br>
Hiroki stood still.<br>
With his back to the shoe cabinet that was filled with slippers, Shogo stared at Hiroki.<br>
The Remington muzzle was pointed down, but Shuya noticed Shogo's finger still on the trigger and felt slightly annoyed.<br>
He did his best not to let it get to him, though.<br>
Hiroki looked at Shuya and Noriko again, and then glanced over at Shogo.<br>
That was when Shuya realized that Hiroki was troubled not so much by him and Noriko as he was by them hooking up with Shogo.<br>
Shogo addressed the issue.<br>
&quot;Shuya, Hiroki seems to want to ask whether it's all right for you guys to be with me.&quot;<br>
Hiroki smiled slightly and looked over at Shogo, and said, &quot;No…I just thought it was an odd combination.&quot; Still smiling, he continued, &quot;Shuya would never be with you if you were hostile.<br>
Shuya can be pretty stupid when it comes to certain things, but he's not that stupid.&quot;<br>
Shogo responded with a grin.<br>
He still kept his finger on the trigger though.<br>
In any case, for now Hiroki and Shogo were finished introducing themselves.<br>
&quot;Ah, come on, Hiroki,&quot; Shuya gave him a smile.<br>
Then Noriko said, &quot;Come on in.<br>
It's not our house, so I can't apologize for its messiness.&quot;<br>
Then Hiroki smiled, but he stayed at the entrance.<br>
Shuya supported Noriko with his left hand and then pointed at the hall.<br>
&quot;Come on in.<br>
We'll have to get going soon, but we have a little time.<br>
We'll throw you a welcoming party.&quot;<br>
But Hiroki stood still there.<br>
Shuya realized how he'd forgotten to share an important detail.<br>
Hiroki might have been appalled Shuya was using the word &quot;party&quot; in this situation.<br>
&quot;Hiroki, we can get out of here.<br>
Shogo is going to help us.&quot;<br>
Hiroki's eyes widened a little.<br>
&quot;Really?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
But then Hiroki looked down.<br>
Then he looked up again.<br>
&quot;Thing is…&quot; he said and shook his head, &quot;there's something I have to take care of.&quot;<br>
&quot;Something?&quot; Shuya knit his brows.<br>
&quot;Why don't you first come on in—&quot;<br>
Instead of taking Shuya up on his invitation, he asked, &quot;Have you three been together all this time?&quot;<br>
Shuya thought it over and then shook his head.<br>
&quot;No…me and Noriko were.<br>
And then…&quot;<br>
Then he remembered what happened this morning.<br>
It'd been a while since the image of Tatsumichi Oki's skull split open assaulted him, and once again he felt a chill run down his spine.<br>
&quot;…yeah.<br>
A lot of stuff happened, and we ended up joining Shogo.&quot;<br>
&quot;I see.&quot; Hiroki nodded and then said.<br>
&quot;Hey, have you guys seen Kotohiki?&quot;<br>
&quot;Kotohiki?&quot; Shuya repeated.<br>
Kayoko Kotohiki (Female Student No.<br>
8)? The one who, in spite of being into tea ceremony, seemed more playful than elegant?<br>
&quot;No…&quot; Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;We haven't but…&quot; He thought of Shogo and looked over at him, but he also shook his head, saying, &quot;I haven't seen her either.&quot;<br>
Of course Kayoko Kotohiki had to be on this island.<br>
As long as her name wasn't announced yet in Sakamochi's announcements, she had to be alive.<br>
That's right—unless she was killed after 6 p.m.<br>
Once again he realized how he was letting most of his classmates die and felt awful.<br>
&quot;What about Kotohiki?&quot; Noriko asked.<br>
&quot;Oh…&quot; Hiroki shook his head.<br>
&quot;It's no big deal.<br>
Thanks.<br>
Sorry, but I have to get going.&quot; He gave Shuya a parting glance and turned to go.<br>
&quot;Hold on, Hiroki!&quot; Shuya stopped him.<br>
&quot;Where are you going? I told you we're safe with us, didn't I?&quot;<br>
Hiroki looked back at Shuya.<br>
There was a sad look in his eyes, but they still gave away that humorous trace of irony.<br>
It might have been a look all his close friends shared.<br>
Yoshitoki Kuninobu (deceased, damn), and of course Shinji Mimura, and—now it seemed—Shogo Kawada.<br>
&quot;I have to see Kayoko Kotohiki about something.<br>
So I have to go.&quot;<br>
Something.<br>
What could that possibly be in this situation where moving around would only increase your chances of dying? Finally Shuya said, &quot;Hold on.<br>
You can't go…not with any real weapons.<br>
It's too risky.<br>
And how are you going to find her?&quot;<br>
Hiroki bit his lower lip.<br>
Then he pulled out that object resembling a mobile data terminal from his pocket and showed it to Shuya.<br>
&quot;This is the 'weapon' I got in my day pack.<br>
Professor Kawada over there could explain.&quot; He pointed at his neck while his hand held the device.<br>
The silver collars around the necks of Shuya, Noriko, and Shogo were all shining.<br>
&quot;Looks like this device detects anyone wearing these collars.<br>
Once someone's in the vicinity, they show up on the screen.<br>
But you can't tell whose collar it is.&quot;<br>
Shuya finally figured out the answer to Shogo's questions.<br>
It was thanks to this device Hiroki had been able to announce there were three of them and detect their movements.<br>
Like the computer at the school monitoring their positions, it could detect the position of anyone wearing a collar, even if, as Hiroki said, you couldn't tell who it was.<br>
Hiroki put the device back into the pocket.<br>
&quot;See you—&quot; He was ready to go when he suddenly stopped,<br>
&quot;That's right…beware of Mitsuko Souma,&quot; he added.<br>
He gave Shuya and then Shogo a stern look.<br>
&quot;She's playing the game.<br>
I don't know about the others, but I know for sure she is.&quot;<br>
&quot;Did you fight her?&quot; Shogo asked.<br>
Hiroki shook his head.<br>
&quot;No.<br>
I didn't, but Takako…Takako Chigusa said so before she died.<br>
Mitsuko killed Takako.&quot;<br>
Shuya suddenly recalled how Takako was already dead.<br>
After hearing Sakamochi announce her death, he'd been concerned about its effect on Hiroki, but he was so happy to see him he'd forgotten this dreadful fact.<br>
That's right, Hiroki and Takako Chigusa were close.<br>
For a while, Shuya actually thought they were going out.<br>
But when he'd casually asked him about it, Hiroki chuckled and said, &quot;She's in a different class.<br>
We've known each other since we were kids.<br>
You know hide-and-seek, that kind of thing.<br>
When we used to fight, I'd be the one crying.&quot; That sounded (of course Takako Chigusa was an amazing athlete, and pretty aggressive, but her taking on Hiroki, who was now over 180 centimeters tall and ranked in martial arts—a while back, that's right, the only time he visited his house, Hiroki reluctantly showed him how he could split a piece of pine wood with the palm of his hand) preposterously funny.<br>
But now Takako Chigusa was dead.<br>
And…given the way Hiroki had just described it, he was there when she died.<br>
&quot;So you were with her?&quot; Noriko asked quietly.<br>
Hiroki shook his head.<br>
&quot;Just the very end.<br>
I…when we left, I hid in front of the school, waiting for her…<br>
but then Yoshio came back, and I got too distracted, so I lost Takako… then… as I looked for Takako I ended up losing my chance to join you, Shuya, and Shinji.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded several times.<br>
So Hiroki was in front of the school until Yoshio Akamatsu returned.<br>
He probably hid in the woods.<br>
It was dangerous, of course.<br>
But that only showed how important Takako was to Hiroki.<br>
&quot;But…&quot; Hiroki continued, &quot;I found Takako…I was…too late though.&quot; Saying this much, Hiroki looked down.<br>
He shook his head several times.<br>
Without being told, Shuya understood that by the time Hiroki had found Takako she was dying from being attacked by Mitsuko.<br>
Shuya thought of telling him how Yoshio Akamatsu had killed Mayumi Tendo, and how he had almost killed Shuya as well, but…it was irrelevant now.<br>
Yoshio Akamatsu was dead now too.<br>
&quot;I don't know what to say, but…I'm so sorry,&quot; Noriko said.<br>
Hiroki smiled a little and nodded.<br>
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br>
&quot;In any case,&quot; Shuya said, &quot;Come on in.<br>
Let's talk it over, what's the—&quot;<br>
He meant to say, rush, but refrained.<br>
If Hiroki wanted to see Kayoko Kotohiki while they were both still alive, what else could he do but rush? While Hiroki's connection to Takako Chigusa was clear, Shuya had no idea why it was so important for him to find Kayoko Kotohiki.<br>
But in any case, as they sat here talking, she could be fighting someone, or she might even be dying.<br>
Hiroki grinned.<br>
It seemed he knew what Shuya was thinking.<br>
Shuya licked his lips.<br>
He glanced over at Shogo and then said, &quot;If you insist…&quot; He looked at Hiroki and continued, &quot;We'll find her with you.&quot;<br>
But Hiroki flatly refused.<br>
He pointed his chin at Noriko.<br>
&quot;Noriko's injured.<br>
It's too dangerous.<br>
No.&quot;<br>
Shuya found the situation unbearable.<br>
&quot;But you could be saved with us__How are we going to meet again if you leave?…&quot; That's right.<br>
Once they separated it would be nearly impossible for them to meet again.<br>
&quot;Hiroki.&quot; It was Shogo.<br>
He still held the shotgun, but his finger wasn't on the trigger anymore.<br>
Hiroki looked over at him, and Shogo pulled out something small from his pocket with his open hand.<br>
He lifted it to his mouth and bit on its metal end, twisting it.<br>
It made the chirping sound of a bird.<br>
It was a loud, brilliant, and playful sound.<br>
Like a robin or chickadee.<br>
Shogo released his hand from his mouth, and Shuya realized that it was Shogo's device—a bird call?<br>
Forget why he would have one in the first place…it was one of those things that mimicked the sound of birds chirping.<br>
&quot;Whether you meet Kayoko Kotohiki or not,&quot; Shogo said, &quot;if you want to see us, make a fire somewhere and burn raw wood to get some smoke going.<br>
Make two fires.<br>
Of course, leave as soon as you make them because you'll only attract attention.<br>
And make sure you don't cause a fire.<br>
Once we see that we'll make this call every fifteen minutes, say, for fifteen seconds.<br>
Try to find us by following this sound.&quot;<br>
He pointed to the bird call.<br>
&quot;This sound is your ticket out of here.<br>
If you're up for it, you can come aboard our train.&quot;<br>
Hiroki nodded.<br>
&quot;Okay.<br>
I will, thanks.&quot;<br>
Shogo took out his map.<br>
He unfolded it and handed the map and his pencil over to Hiroki.<br>
&quot;Also, I'm sorry for keeping you, but I need you to mark where Takako was killed.<br>
If you saw anyone else, I need to know those locations too.&quot;<br>
Hiroki lifted his brow slightly as he took the map.<br>
He spread the map out on the shoe cabinet, under the moonlit window, and held the pencil.<br>
&quot;Give me your map.<br>
I'll write in the locations of the bodies we know,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
Hiroki stopped writing and handed over his map.<br>
The two began marking the maps side by side.<br>
&quot;I'll bring some coffee over,&quot; Noriko said and left Shuya's arm.<br>
She limped down the hall, using the wall as support.<br>
&quot;Did Takako say whether Mitsuko had a machine gun?&quot; Shogo asked as he wrote.<br>
&quot;No,&quot; Hiroki answered without lifting his eyes, &quot;She didn't say anything about that.<br>
I do know that she was shot several times.<br>
It wasn't a single bullet.&quot; I see.<br>
As the two proceeded, Shuya explained the fates of Yoshio Akamatsu, Tatsumichi Oki, and Kyoichi Motobuchi.<br>
Hiroki nodded as he continued to write.<br>
Shogo was done marking Hiroki's map.<br>
He pointed at it and explained, &quot;This is where Kaori Minami was killed.<br>
Shuya saw Hirono Shimizu escape.<br>
She might have done it in self-defense.<br>
But either way, you should be careful.&quot;<br>
Hiroki nodded.<br>
Then unexpectedly he said, &quot;I saw Kaori too,&quot; and pointed at the map.<br>
&quot;Before noon.<br>
She fired at me, but I think she was in a panic.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded and exchanged Hiroki's map with his.<br>
Noriko came out into the hall, holding a cup.<br>
Shuya went down the hall and took it from Noriko, who walked unsteadily.<br>
He offered it to Hiroki, who took a sniff, whistled lightly, and then held it.<br>
&quot;Thanks,&quot;<br>
he said and took a sip.<br>
Then he put the cup on the raised entrance floor.<br>
It was nearly full.<br>
&quot;I'll see ya.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hold on.&quot; Shuya pulled out his SIG-Sauer from under his belt.<br>
With its grip pointed at Hiroki, he offered it to him.<br>
He also pulled out an extra cartridge from his pocket.<br>
&quot;If you still insist on going take these, okay? We have a shotgun and one more gun.&quot;<br>
The first gun was Kyoichi Motobuchi's, and the Smith &amp; Wesson was now with Shogo.<br>
Shuya's handing over the SIG-Sauer gun would decrease their fighting capacity, but Shogo didn't intervene.<br>
But Hiroki shook his head.<br>
&quot;You need that, Shuya.<br>
You better protect Noriko all right.<br>
I can't take that.<br>
Even if someone attacks me, I just can't do it.&quot; He tilted his head and then examined both Shuya and Noriko.<br>
He broke into a slight grin and then added, &quot;I always wondered why you two weren't going out.&quot;<br>
Then he nodded at each of them and quietly opened the entrance door.<br>
&quot;Hiroki,&quot; Noriko called.<br>
Her voice was quiet.<br>
&quot;Be careful.&quot;<br>
&quot;I will.<br>
Hey, thanks.<br>
And best of luck to you guys.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hiroki…&quot; Shuya was getting choked up, but managed to say, &quot;We'll meet again.<br>
That's a promise.&quot;<br>
Hiroki nodded and left.<br>
Shuya held Noriko and stepped through the front entrance, watching Hiroki as he quickly ascended the mountain.<br>
Without a word, Shogo gestured to Shuya and Noriko to move back and close the door.<br>
Shuya took a deep breath and turned around.<br>
He could barely see the steam still rising from the cup Hiroki had left on the floor.<br>
20 students remaining<br>
49<br>
The moon was high in the center of the sky.<br>
There wasn't a single cloud.<br>
The white light from the nearly full moon cast a thin film over the rest of the sky, obscuring the stars.<br>
Shogo, who was leading, stopped.<br>
Shuya, who was supporting Noriko with his shoulder, stopped too.<br>
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Shuya asked Noriko.<br>
She nodded.<br>
&quot;I'm fine.&quot; But Shuya could tell she was still unsteady.<br>
Shuya looked at his watch.<br>
It was past 11 p.m.<br>
now, but they'd already left G=9, which was now a forbidden zone.<br>
They had to find another place to settle down.<br>
They were tracing their way back along the foot of the northern mountain.<br>
The area was scattered with trees.<br>
A little further down and they'd be near where Kaori Minami was killed.<br>
Immediately to their left, Shuya saw a flat, narrow area that extended from the island's residential area on the eastern shore.<br>
The flat land spotted with houses then became increasingly narrow, like a triangle.<br>
The road traversing the island supposedly passed through this pivot and headed to the western shore.<br>
Shogo turned around.<br>
&quot;Now what do we do?&quot; Noriko's blanket was tied to the top of the day pack on his shoulder.<br>
&quot;Can we stop at a house, like we did just now?&quot;<br>
&quot;A house, huh.&quot; Shogo looked away from Shuya and squinted.<br>
&quot;It's really not a good idea.<br>
As the number of zones decrease so do the number of houses.<br>
The moment someone needs something, they'll want to enter a house.<br>
Whether it's to eat or whatever.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey, if you're worried about me, I'm fine now.<br>
Even outside,&quot; Noriko said.<br>
Shogo flashed a smile and then silently looked over the flat land.<br>
He looked as if he was taking Hiroki's marks on his map into consideration as he took in the view.<br>
Along with the bodies he'd seen, Hiroki had given detailed explanations of how they had died.<br>
The body of Kazushi Nüda was right near where Takako Chigusa had died.<br>
Along with his eyes being gouged out (!), his throat had been stabbed.<br>
In the residential area that was now forbidden was Megumi Eto.<br>
Her throat had been slashed by a blade.<br>
(Shuya felt a pang in his chest over this one, since Noriko had told him how Megumi had a crush on him.) To the east, Yoji Kuramoto and Yoshimi Yahagi were killed where the eastern shore's residential area met the southern mountain.<br>
Yoji was stabbed in the head, and Yoshimi had been shot.<br>
At the southern tip, Izumi Kanai, Hiroshi Kuronaga, Ryuhei Sasagawa, and Mitsuru Numai were all found dead together.<br>
Mitsuru Numai was shot several times, while the others'<br>
throats were slashed.<br>
Three of Kiriyama's group had died together, the only exception being Sho Tsukioka, who got caught in a forbidden zone.<br>
&quot;Shogo,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
Shogo looked back.<br>
&quot;Do you think Mitsuko Souma killed Yukiko and Yumiko?&quot;<br>
Even now, as he asked this, it all felt so unreal.<br>
He didn't believe a girl could do such horrible things.<br>
Of course he had no doubt, since it was Hiroki who'd informed them, but he still couldn't restrain the urge to dismiss it all as a delusion.<br>
&quot;No,&quot; Shogo shook his head.<br>
&quot;I don't think so.<br>
After Yukiko and Yumiko got killed by that machine gun, you know how we heard pistols going off? That was to finish them off.<br>
But Hiroki said Takako was alive after being shot when he found her.<br>
Which means her killer wasn't as thorough.<br>
Of course she might have let Takako go, knowing she was going to die anyway.<br>
But given the times and locations, I just don't think Mitsuko Souma's the one with the machine gun.&quot;<br>
Shuya recalled the machine gun fire he heard before 9 a.m.<br>
The killer was still roaming around the island.<br>
And the distant gunfire they heard a little afterwards…was that Mitsuko Souma?<br>
&quot;Eventually we'll…&quot; Shogo forced a grin and shook his head, &quot;…meet him or her.<br>
Then we'll know for sure.&quot;<br>
Shuya recalled something else that had been bugging him.<br>
&quot;When Hiroki showed us his radar, I was thinking how Sakamochi must know we're together and our positions as well.&quot;<br>
Shogo answered as he surveyed the flat land, &quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
Shuya moved his shoulder to give Noriko better support.<br>
&quot;Won't that hinder our escape?&quot;<br>
Shogo chuckled with his back to Shuya.<br>
&quot;Nope.<br>
Not at all.<br>
Don't worry.&quot; Shogo looked over the flat land again and said, &quot;Let's go back to where we were.&quot;<br>
He continued, &quot;A common strategy players in this game take is to show up anywhere they hear some action.<br>
That's because of the 24-hour deadline.<br>
Because of that limitation, they kill when they can.<br>
And the fact that they're on a killing spree means they're on their own, so they can't afford to sleep much.<br>
So the match has to be kept short.<br>
If something happens near them, they go there, and if there's a fight already going on, they sit back and then they finish off any survivors.<br>
That's why we should stay somewhere we can avoid confrontations.<br>
If we get mixed up with someone who's panicking then one of the top players is bound to show up.<br>
If we go back where we were it's unlikely we'll meet anyone.<br>
Since Tatsumichi Old and Kyoichi Motobuchi, who'd been hiding there, are no longer around, that area is pretty much uninhabited.&quot;<br>
&quot;But Hirono ran in that direction.&quot;<br>
&quot;No, I doubt she's gone that far.<br>
It wouldn't be necessary.&quot; Shogo pointed to the flat land with his thumb.<br>
&quot;But we'll avoid this mountain where she might be hiding.<br>
We'll take a different route.&quot;<br>
Shuya lifted his brow.<br>
&quot;Is it safe for us to move through the flat land?&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled and shook his head.<br>
&quot;The moon may be shining, but this isn't daylight.<br>
I think we're safer there than in the mountain, where there's too much cover.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
Shogo took the lead and began descending the slope.<br>
Shuya held the SIG-Sauer tightly in his right hand and followed Shogo as he supported Noriko.<br>
The trees turned into a field of short grass.<br>
The first farm they came across had a field full of squashes.<br>
Beyond this field there was a wheat field.<br>
This island was so small these probably weren't for domestic consumption.<br>
Of course the Republic of Greater East Asia was incessantly issuing orders to promote national self-reliance, so even a small farm like this might contribute a little to the effort.<br>
As they moved along the edge of the farm, the soil under their sneakers felt dry.<br>
Maybe it was because several days had passed since the area had been evacuated.<br>
Still, Shuya was struck by the pleasant, rich odor of wheat drifting through the evening air, anticipating the summer.<br>
It was a nice smell.<br>
Especially after having smelled so much blood.<br>
There was a tractor to their left.<br>
Beyond the vehicle there was a house.<br>
It was an ordinary, two-story house and appeared relatively new.<br>
It was probably one of those cheap, mass produced buildings resembling Banana Homes or Vertebrae Houses.<br>
Even though it was in the middle of the farm, it was enclosed by a concrete wall.<br>
Shuya looked at Shogo's back as he moved forward.<br>
Something irked him.<br>
He looked back.<br>
Noriko was leaning on his left shoulder as she walked, but he noticed something high above her head in the middle of the sky.<br>
Something flashing in the moonlight, tracing an arc.<br>
This object came flying at them.<br>
20 students remaining<br>
50<br>
What made Shuya such a star athlete in his Little League days was his incredible ability to perceive objects in motion.<br>
Even in this dim light Shuya could tell that the object flying towards them right now resembled a can.<br>
Of course, they were in the serene Seto Inland Sea region, so it couldn't possibly be an empty can falling from the sky from a hurricane.<br>
There was no way it was an empty can.<br>
No.<br>
Shuya suddenly released his shoulder, which was tucked under Noriko's right armpit.<br>
He couldn't even afford to call on Shogo, who must have realized something odd though, because he also suddenly turned around, while Noriko tottered without Shuya's support.<br>
Shuya dashed out.<br>
His jumping ability was quite extraordinary.<br>
Just as in the past, during the Little League prefectural semifinals, he could make the ultimate play from any given position, stealing the opponents' winning home run in the bottom of the eleventh inning.<br>
Shuya caught the ball—no, the can—in mid-air with his left hand.<br>
He put it in his right hand, and as he came down he twisted his body and threw it as far as he could.<br>
Before Shuya landed a bright light shined through the night.<br>
He felt the air burst as a sonic boom tore through his eardrums.<br>
The bomb blast blew him away before he could land, and he fell sprawling onto the ground.<br>
If he'd waited for the hand grenade to fall, he, Noriko, and Shogo would have all been mincemeat now.<br>
Although Sakamochi's crew might have reduced the grenade's explosive power so that it couldn't be used against the school, it was more than capable of killing human beings.<br>
He raised his head.<br>
He realized, he heard nothing.<br>
His ears were screwed up.<br>
In this state of silence, Shuya saw Noriko collapsed on his left.<br>
Then he lifted his face to look back at Shogo and saw…another can flying at them.<br>
Another one! I have to…but it was too late now.<br>
His disabled ears all of a sudden heard a definite but muffled bang, almost simultaneously followed by another explosion in the air.<br>
This sound was also muffled, but this time it felt a little further off and Shuya wasn't blown away.<br>
Right beside him Shogo was on one knee, holding his shotgun.<br>
He had shot the hand grenade, as if he were skeet shooting, blowing it to bits before it managed to explode.<br>
Shuya ran over to Noriko and held her up.<br>
She was grimacing.<br>
She seemed to be moaning, but he couldn't hear her.<br>
&quot;Shuya, get back!&quot;<br>
Shogo waved his hand and fired his shotgun with his right hand.<br>
Shuya then heard a different sound, rattling gunfire, and the wheat heads right in front of him scattered into the air.<br>
Shogo fired another two shots.<br>
In a state of confusion, Shuya pulled Noriko into the shade of the ridge marking off the farm.<br>
He got down.<br>
Shogo slid to his side, firing several shots as he went.<br>
The rattling continued, and the ridge soil blew up, grains flying into his eyes.<br>
Shuya pulled out his SIG-Sauer and looked out from the shade of the ridge.<br>
He fired blindly in the direction Shogo was firing.<br>
Then he saw him.<br>
Less than thirty meters away, the unique slicked-back hair behind the break in the house's concrete wall.<br>
It was Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No.<br>
6).<br>
And although Shuya's hearing was impaired, he could recall the sound of the rattling gunfire.<br>
It was the same sound he heard from far away when Yumiko and Yukiko fell at the northern mountain peak.<br>
Of course he might not have been the only one with a machine gun, but even so, Kazuo, who was right in front of their very own eyes, had just tried to kill them without warning, with of all things a hand grenade!<br>
Shuya was certain Kazuo was the one who'd murdered Yumiko and Yukiko.<br>
He thought of how they were killed and felt a flash of rage.<br>
&quot;What the…what's the hell's he doing!?&quot;<br>
&quot;Stop shouting, just shoot!&quot; Shogo handed the Smith &amp; Wesson to Shuya and reloaded his shotgun.<br>
Shuya held a gun in each hand and began shooting at the concrete wall.<br>
(Two-hand shooter! This is crazy!) First the Smith &amp; Wesson, then the SIG-Sauer ran out of bullets.<br>
He had to reload!<br>
Having waited for this moment, Kazuo got up.<br>
BRRRRATTA.<br>
Sparks flew out from him.<br>
Shuya ducked, and Kazuo revealed part of his body that was behind the wall.<br>
Shogo blasted his shotgun away.<br>
Kazuo's body once again vanished.<br>
The swarm of shotgun pellets blew off part of the wall.<br>
Shuya ejected the empty magazine from his SIG-Sauer and pulled out a loaded magazine from his pocket.<br>
He opened the Smith &amp; Wesson cylinder and pushed the rod in the center of the cylinder to release its spent shells, puffed up from the explosions.<br>
One of the shells nearly singed part of his right thumb.<br>
It didn't matter.<br>
He quickly loaded the .38 caliber bullets Shogo had rolled over his way.<br>
Then he aimed at Kazuo's house.<br>
Shogo shot again, blowing off another part of the wall.<br>
Shuya also fired several shots into it with his SIG-Sauer.<br>
&quot;Noriko! Are you all right!?&quot; Shuya yelled.<br>
Right next to him, Noriko answered, &quot;I'm okay.&quot; He could make out her response, which made Shuya realize his hearing was back.<br>
He saw her in the corner of his eye reloading 9mm Short bullets into the SIG-Sauer's empty magazine.<br>
Of all the things he'd seen since the game began this one really sent his head reeling.<br>
How could a girl like Noriko be participating in a battle like this…<br>
A hand appeared from the other side of the wall.<br>
The hand was holding a machine gun.<br>
It rattled again.<br>
Shuya and Shogo ducked.<br>
Kazuo got up.<br>
As he continued shooting, he came forward.<br>
Then he ran behind the tractor.<br>
The distance between them was shrinking.<br>
Shogo fired a shot, blowing off the tractor's driving panel.<br>
&quot;Shogo,&quot; Shuya called, after shooting twice.<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Shogo answered as he reloaded his shotgun.<br>
&quot;How fast can you run the hundred-meter dash?&quot;<br>
Shogo took another shot (annihilating the tractor's rear light) and answered, &quot;I'm pretty slow.<br>
Maybe thirteen seconds.<br>
My back's strong though.<br>
What?&quot;<br>
Suddenly Kazuo's arm stuck out from behind the tractor.<br>
Sparks flew as Kazuo revealed his head, but as Shuya and Shogo fired back, he ducked again.<br>
&quot;We can only retreat into the mountain, right?&quot; Shuya spoke quickly.<br>
&quot;I can run a hundred meters in almost less than eleven seconds.<br>
You and Noriko go ahead.<br>
I'll keep Kazuo there.&quot;<br>
Shogo glanced at Shuya.<br>
That was all.<br>
He understood.<br>
&quot;At the place we were, Shuya.<br>
The place where we talked about rock,&quot; Shogo said quickly.<br>
He gave Shuya his shotgun and retreated into a ducking position.<br>
He moved around over to Noriko.<br>
Shuya took a deep breath and shot three times into the tractor with the shotgun, prompting Shogo to lift Noriko and run in the direction they'd come from.<br>
Noriko's eyes flashed by Shuya's for a moment.<br>
Kazuo's upper body appeared from behind the tractor.<br>
Shuya fired his shotgun several times.<br>
Kazuo, who had his gun pointed at Shogo and Noriko, ducked.<br>
Shuya realized he was out of shotgun shells so he picked up the Smith &amp; Wesson instead and began shooting again.<br>
He immediately used up five bullets.<br>
He opened the SIG-Sauer and loaded the extra magazine Noriko had loaded with bullets and began shooting again.<br>
It was crucial he keep on shooting.<br>
He saw Shogo and Noriko disappear into the mountain.<br>
The SIG-Sauer was empty, and there were no more extra magazines.<br>
He could only reload bullets....<br>
But then this time Kazuo's arm appeared from behind the tractor's blade.<br>
The Ingram machine gun rattled away.<br>
Just like before.<br>
Kazuo was running towards him!<br>
Shuya had to get out of this gunfight.<br>
He held onto only the empty SIG-Sauer (he still had seven more individual 9mm Short bullets), turned around, and ran.<br>
If he could reach the mountain where there was plenty of cover, Kazuo wouldn't be able to get too close to him.<br>
Shuya decided to head east.<br>
Noriko and Shogo would be headed west to get where they were yesterday.<br>
He wanted to lead Kazuo as far away from them as he could.<br>
It all came down to his sprinting speed.<br>
He had to get as far away from Kazuo as possible in a short span of time.<br>
A machine gun basically offered a shower of bullets so it was impossible to dodge at a close distance.<br>
What mattered was how far he could get.<br>
Shuya ran.<br>
As the fastest runner in the class (at least he thought so.<br>
He was even a fraction of a second faster than Shinji Mimura, unless, that is, if Kazuo wasn't really trying during his test), he could only rely on his speed.<br>
Right when he thought he was five meters away from a tree he heard a rattling sound.<br>
He felt a severe blow against the left side of his stomach.<br>
Shuya groaned as he began losing his balance, but he kept on running.<br>
He ran into a row of tall trees and made his way up the slope.<br>
The rattling resumed and this time his left arm reflexively flinched up.<br>
He realized he'd been shot right above his elbow.<br>
But he still ran.<br>
He continued east—hey, yo, that's a forbidden zone—and moved north.<br>
More rattling.<br>
A thin tree to his right crackled and burst into matchstick-sized splinters.<br>
More rattling.<br>
This time he wasn't hit.<br>
Or maybe he was.<br>
He couldn't tell anymore.<br>
He only knew he was being chased.<br>
At least he was buying time for Noriko and Shogo.<br>
He made his way through the trees and vegetation, climbed a hill, and then descended it.<br>
He couldn't even afford to worry that there might be someone else hiding in the dark, waiting to attack him.<br>
He had no idea how far he'd gotten.<br>
He wasn't even sure which direction he was running.<br>
Sometimes it seemed like he could hear—sometimes it seemed like he couldn't—the rattling sound.<br>
He couldn't tell maybe because his hearing had been impaired by that explosion.<br>
In any case now was not the time to be relieved.<br>
Farther.<br>
He had to get farther.<br>
Suddenly Shuya slipped.<br>
He'd somehow reached a cliff, and all of a sudden realized that the slope just dropped off.<br>
Just as he'd done when fighting Tatsumichi Oki, he tumbled down the steep slope.<br>
He landed with a thud.<br>
He was no longer holding the SIG-Sauer.<br>
And as he tried to stand up…<br>
He realized he couldn't.<br>
He wondered, in a daze, am I delirious from blood loss? Or…did I hit my head?<br>
Impossible.<br>
I'm not injured so badly I can't stand up...I have to get back to Noriko and Shogo...I have to protect Noriko, I promised Noriko…<br>
As he tried to get up though, he fell forward…<br>
…and lost consciousness.<br>
20 students remaining<br>
51<br>
It was almost pitch dark, but beside the dimly moonlit window Shinji tossed the item in his hand once again onto the floor.<br>
The sound of it hitting the floor was muffled by the thick folded blanket, but there was a popping sound along with a ring.<br>
Shinji immediately picked it up off the floor and then tucked the small plastic item inside the blanket.<br>
The sound stopped.<br>
&quot;Come on, let's go,&quot; Yutaka said.<br>
He'd been watching over Shinji, but Shinji signaled him to calm down.<br>
He repeated the test again.<br>
Pop, zing.<br>
It made the same sounds.<br>
Shinji picked it up, and it stopped.<br>
Was it all right? But if this malfunctioned, then all the careful preparations they'd made would come to nothing.<br>
One more try—<br>
&quot;We have to hurry…&quot; Yutaka said again, and Shinji's face was about to flush with anger—but he managed to suppress it.<br>
Although he wasn't entirely satisfied he said, &quot;All right,&quot; and concluded his test.<br>
He unhooked the lead wire connecting the battery and mini-motor which was used for the test and began peeling off the plastic tape attaching the motor unit to the battery.<br>
Shuya and Yutaka were back at the &quot;Northern Takamatsu Agricultural Cooperative Association, Okishima Island Branch.&quot;<br>
Along with the school and harbor fishery coop, it might have been one of the largest buildings on the island.<br>
The space, unlit of course and enveloped in darkness, was the size of a basketball court, and there was farming equipment strewn all over the area, including a tractor and combine harvester.<br>
There was also a light truck with a missing wheel lifted on a jack, probably to be repaired.<br>
Then in the corner were piles of sacks of various kinds of fertilizer.<br>
(And hazardous ammonium nitrate was further beyond them, stored in a large cabinet with a provisional lock that Shinji had busted open.) The slate walls were at least five meters high, and there was an upper floor attached along the north wall where more fertilizer, insecticide, and other supplies had been stored.<br>
On the opposite, or east, wall was a steel staircase diagonally descending from the second floor, and underneath the stairs was a large sliding warehouse door.<br>
Next to this sliding door, in front of the stairs in the southeast corner, was an officelike space made up of partition walls.<br>
Beyond its open door he could make out office equipment, including the outlines of a desk and fax machine.<br>
Setting the wire across sector G=7 where the school was turned out to be a hassle.<br>
First, Shinji tied the end of the wire to the tip of a tall tree behind the rock they'd climbed on.<br>
Then he took the other end and began walking between the trees, but then a gust in the upper region of the sky acted up, so guiding the garbage-bag balloons proved to be difficult.<br>
There were at least ten occasions where he had to climb up a tree to loosen the wire.<br>
On top of that, given how the enemy could be anywhere in the dark, he had to worry about Yutaka, so the endeavor ended up exhausting him.<br>
But he'd managed to set the wire after a full three hours, when he heard the gunfight.<br>
It was past 11 p.m.<br>
He heard an explosion as well, but he couldn't afford to get involved, so he hurried back to the farm coop with Yutaka.<br>
By then the gunfire had ceased.<br>
Finally Shinji began building the electric detonator, but this also turned out to be difficult.<br>
He didn't have the proper tools, and furthermore the device required a delicate balance.<br>
Electric current had to run through the device at the moment of impact against the school, but at the same time he had to make sure it wasn't so sensitive it'd be ignited in the middle of the rope cable by, say, a bump or knot in the rope.<br>
But somehow he managed to build it, using a motor (which he removed from an electric razor) instead of the detonator for the test.<br>
It was right when he began testing, in other words, only moments ago, that the midnight announcement was made.<br>
The only one who died was Hirono Shimizu (Female Student No.<br>
10), whom Shinji saw immediately after the game began.<br>
He thought it might have been a result of that intense gun battle, but in any case Sakamochi had announced something far more urgent, at least to him and Yutaka.<br>
Sector F=7, which included the cliff rock they'd climbed up on to survey the school, was designated to be a forbidden zone as of 1 a.m.<br>
No wonder Yutaka was so impatient.<br>
If they couldn't enter that area then all their preparations would amount to nothing.<br>
It would be the end for them.<br>
He didn't want to be in the situation of, after a clever play, being just one move away from checkmate only to fall into a fatal trap.<br>
Shinji quickly pulled out the electric detonator from the tube chained to his knife.<br>
He connected the two cylinders— their dull metallic exterior shone in the dark—and peeled off the insulation from the lead wire.<br>
Then using tape, he first secured the small plastic spring serving as the electrical switch, then took the end of the lead wire extending from the detonator and tied it to the wire from the charge device.<br>
He taped the connection over and over so it would be completely secure.<br>
Then next to the battery he installed a condenser circuit board taken from the flash component of a camera.<br>
In order for the detonator to be absolutely reliable, he needed a high voltage output.<br>
He connected the wires to this device as well.<br>
To prevent any accidental detonation, he decided he would work on the remaining wire from the electric detonator at the top of the mountain, taping the exposed end of the wire to the side of the battery.<br>
&quot;All right.&quot;<br>
Shinji stood up, and then put the completed detonation device in his pocket.<br>
&quot;Let's hurry.<br>
It's time.&quot;<br>
Yutaka nodded.<br>
Just in case, Shinji tossed his equipment, including the electrical pliers and extra lead wire into his day pack, and then lifted several piles of rope they had divided up onto his shoulder.<br>
He looked down.<br>
There was a gas can filled up with a mixture of gasoline and ammonium nitrate.<br>
To add oxygen, he stuffed in insulation material filled with air and folded in pleats.<br>
The opening was shut with the lid, but next to it another rubber lid functioning as the detonator holder was tied to it with a plastic cord dangling from the handle.<br>
Then he looked at his watch.<br>
It was 12:09.<br>
They had plenty of time.<br>
Okay then.<br>
He was trembling from excitement.<br>
It took a lot of effort, but now they had everything they needed.<br>
They would connect all the ropes they had, tying one end to a tree in H=7.<br>
Then they would tie the other end of the rope to the end of the fishing wire secured by the weight of a rock.<br>
They would unravel the rope and leave it there and then go around the school, going up the mountain into F=7.<br>
He would take the wire tied to the top of the tree and reel it in immediately.<br>
The rope stuck to the wire would then come to them.<br>
He would proceed to attach the pulley to the gas-can gondola with the detonation device and thread the rope through it.<br>
Then he would stretch the rope taut with one swift motion and secure it to a tree.<br>
Then the rest is…party time, dude.<br>
Have fun! Here we go! Make it happen!<br>
Once they had done some damage to the school's computer, or its electrical current or wiring, Sakamochi's staff would suspect a system failure, no, given the power of explosives here once the entire computer, no, in fact half the school was blown up, then they would take the tire tubes they'd already hidden behind the rock in F=7 and run towards the western shore, escaping by sea as planned.<br>
If they could mislead the government by sending a false SOS signal using their transistor radio and get to the next island, Toyoshima, in less than a half an hour as calculated, then they would take a boat.<br>
(He had experience with a motor boat.<br>
He was really appreciating all the wisdom his late uncle had imparted.) Then they would probably escape into Okayama, hopefully landing on an obscure shore, and then they'd be fine.<br>
They could take a freight train heading to the countryside.<br>
Or they would furnish themselves with a car passing by.<br>
After all, he had a gun.<br>
Carjack.<br>
Nice.<br>
Shinji looked down at the Beretta M92F tucked into his belt.<br>
He was planning on slipping through by misleading the government, but just in case they were found at sea, he'd filled several Coke bottles with his special ammonium nitrate-gasoline mixture and stuffed them into his day pack.<br>
But without a detonator they were basically just Molotov cocktails.<br>
If they were detected, it would be best to swim toward the guard ship and get on board to fight.<br>
If all went well they could get their hands on the enemy's weapons, and if they could operate the ship, it could provide their means of escape.<br>
But he would have to be a good shot to accomplish this.<br>
He was a little…concerned.<br>
He'd been running all over the island with his Beretta, but come to think of it, he hadn't fired it once.<br>
And even his uncle didn't have a gun, so he'd never learned how to use one.<br>
But Shinji shook his head.<br>
The Third Man, Shinji Mimura.<br>
No prob.<br>
The first time he held a heavy basketball and tossed a free throw, the ball swooped right through the basket.<br>
&quot;Shinji.&quot; Yutaka called him.<br>
Shinji looked up.<br>
&quot;Are you ready?&quot;<br>
&quot;No…&quot; Yutaka said pitifully.<br>
And then he nervously wrote something on the memo pad.<br>
Shinji read it under the moonlight by the window.<br>
It read, I can't find the pulley.<br>
He glanced at Yutaka.<br>
For all he knew he might look really mad.<br>
Yutaka suddenly drew back.<br>
Yutaka was in charge of half of the rope supply and the pulley.<br>
Ever since Shinji took the pulley from the well, Yutaka had been in charge of it, bringing it over here and putting it somewhere.<br>
Shinji put his bundles of rope and day pack down again.<br>
He began searching the area on his knees.<br>
Yutaka did the same.<br>
They groped in the dark, looking beyond the tractor and below the work desk, but they couldn't find it.<br>
Shinji stood up and checked his watch again.<br>
Instead of 12:10, it was approaching 12:15.<br>
Finally, he decided to take out the flashlight from his day pack.<br>
He cupped the bulb area with his hands and turned it on.<br>
He did his best not to let any light leak out, but the interior of the warehouselike pseudo farm coop glowed a faint yellow.<br>
Shinji saw Yutaka's worried face and then beyond his shoulder, he easily located the pulley, lying beyond the moonlight from the window on the floor by the plain wall behind the desk.<br>
It was less than a meter away from Yutaka's day pack on the floor.<br>
Shinji signaled Yutaka and quickly turned off the flashlight.<br>
Yutaka snatched up the pulley.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, Shinji,&quot; Yutaka said apologetically.<br>
Shinji forced a grin, &quot;Get it together, Yutaka.&quot;<br>
Then he shouldered the day pack and rope once again.<br>
He lifted the gas can.<br>
He was confident about his strength, but two of these items were pretty heavy.<br>
Carrying the rope would only be partway, but he would have to carry the twenty-kilogram gas can to the top of the mountain.<br>
And they had to hurry too.<br>
Yutaka carried his bundle of rope (the heavy load made him look like a tortoise weighed down by its shell.<br>
Well, Shinji looked no different), and they walked to the sliding door on the east side of the building.<br>
The door had been opened approximately ten centimeters, letting in a thin ray of pale blue moonlight.<br>
&quot;I'm so sorry, Shinji,&quot; Yutaka said again.<br>
&quot;It's all right.<br>
Don't worry.<br>
Let's just make sure we get it right from here on.&quot;<br>
Shinji shifted the gas can to his left hand, put his right hand on the heavy steel door, and slid it open.<br>
The pale light spread out.<br>
Outside there was an unpaved parking lot.<br>
Its entrance was on the right.<br>
The farm coop faced a narrow road.<br>
Near its entrance was a station wagon.<br>
The wide longitudinal road traversing the island was slightly south of this road.<br>
In front of the door, east of the parking lot, was a farm made up of several houses.<br>
Beyond that area was another cluster of houses, and even in the dark you could see them.<br>
To his left Shinji saw a small storage shack at the end of the property, and further on up was the school, and above it, as if it were embracing it, the cliff.<br>
There were some trees right by a two-story house in front of the school.<br>
They were planning on tying the rope to the tallest tree there.<br>
They had secured the wire near the farm's waterway immediately left of the tree.<br>
So the wire went by the school and directly up into the center of the mountain, where the overlooking rock was, covering an amazing distance of three hundred meters.<br>
I can't believe I came up with this plan.<br>
I wonder though, whether that wire will really lift the rope up to the mountain without getting cut?<br>
Shinji took a breath and then after considering it, he decided to say something.<br>
It wouldn't matter whether they heard him say this.<br>
&quot;Yutaka.&quot;<br>
Yutaka looked up at Shinji.<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;We might die.<br>
Are you prepared for that?&quot;<br>
For a moment Yutaka fell silent.<br>
But then he answered immediately, &quot;Yeah, I'm ready.&quot;<br>
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br>
Shinji gripped the handle of the gas can again and was about to form a smile…<br>
…that froze when he saw something in the corner of his eye.<br>
Someone's head emerged from the farm east of the parking lot.<br>
&quot;Yutaka!&quot;<br>
Shinji grabbed Yutaka's arm and ran back behind the sliding door into the slate-walled farm coop building.<br>
Yutaka teetered for a moment, partially due to the heavy rope, but managed to follow him.<br>
By the time they were crouched over behind the sliding door, Shinji already had his gun aimed at the figure.<br>
The figure shrieked, &quot;D-don't shoot! Shinji! Please don't shoot! It's me! Keita!&quot;<br>
Shinji realized it was Keita Iijima (Male Student No.<br>
2).<br>
Keita, relatively speaking, was friendly and got along with Shinji and Yutaka (after all they'd been classmates since their first year), but Shinji wasn't relieved someone was joining them.<br>
No, he felt like this meant trouble.<br>
That's when he realized he hadn't given much thought to the possibility of others joining them until now.<br>
Damn, why now!<br>
&quot;It's Keita, Shinji.<br>
Come on, it's Keita.&quot;<br>
Shinji thought Yutaka's excited voice sounded a little inappropriate.<br>
Keita slowly stood up and proceeded toward the farm coop premises.<br>
He held his day pack in his left hand and what looked like a kitchen knife in his right.<br>
He spoke cautiously.<br>
&quot;I saw the light.&quot;<br>
Shinji clenched his teeth.<br>
It must have come from the flashlight he'd used just that one time to find the pulley.<br>
Shinji chided himself, how could he have screwed up like that, rushing to use that flashlight?<br>
Keita continued, &quot;So I came here and saw that it was you guys…what are you doing? What were you carrying? Rope? Let me…let me join you guys.&quot;<br>
Knowing how their conversations were monitored, Yutaka knit his brow and looked over at Shinji, his eyes opened wide, realizing how Shinji hadn't lowered his gun.<br>
&quot;Sh-Shinji, what's going on?&quot;<br>
Shinji moved his open right hand and signaled Yutaka not to move forward.<br>
&quot;Yutaka.<br>
Don't move.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; Keita said.<br>
His voice was shaking.<br>
&quot;Why are you pointing that at me?&quot;<br>
Shinji took a deep breath and said to Keita, &quot;Don't move.&quot; He could tell Yutaka was getting tense.<br>
Keita Iijima's pitiful face was visible in the moonlight as he took a step forward.<br>
&quot;Why? Why won't you let me? Have you forgotten who I am, Shinji? Let me join you guys.&quot;<br>
Shinji cocked his gun with a click.<br>
Keita Iijima stopped.<br>
They still had plenty of distance, seven or eight meters.<br>
&quot;Don't come near us,&quot; Shinji slowly repeated.<br>
&quot;I can't let you join.&quot;<br>
Yutaka whined right beside him, &quot;Why, Shinji? We can trust Keita.&quot;<br>
Shinji shook his head.<br>
Then he thought, that's right, there's something you don't know about us, Yutaka.<br>
It wasn't a big deal.<br>
In fact it was a trivial incident.<br>
It happened during their second year near the end of the term in March.<br>
Shinji went to Takamatsu to see a movie (there was no movie theater in Shiroiwa) with Keita Iijima.<br>
Yutaka was supposed to go too, but he had a cold that day.<br>
That was how Shinji encountered three tough-looking high school students in a back alley off the main street near the shopping arcade.<br>
Shinji and Keita had already seen the movie, and once they were done checking out the book and record stores (Shinji bought imported computer books.<br>
They were lucky finds.<br>
Even though they were technical books, the government strictly prohibited books from the West so they were difficult to come by), they were heading over to the train station when Keita realized he'd forgot to buy a comic book and went back to the bookstore alone.<br>
&quot;Hey, you got any dough?&quot; one of the high school students asked.<br>
This guy was at least ten centimeters taller than Shinji, who at 172 meters was short for a basketball player.<br>
Shinji shrugged.<br>
&quot;I think I have 2,571 yen.&quot;<br>
The interrogator looked at the other two as if saying, how lame.<br>
Then he leaned over by Shinji's ear.<br>
Shinji was annoyed.<br>
Maybe it was from getting wasted on paint thinner or some wacky drug that was hip these days, in any case the guy's gums were receding, and the smell of his breath coming between his teeth reeked.<br>
Brush your teeth, man.<br>
The guy said, &quot;Give it up.<br>
Come on, now.&quot;<br>
Shinji gave an exaggerated look of surprise and said, &quot;Oh, so you guys are homeless! You know you should be content with twenty yen then.<br>
I actually might give you something if you get on your knees and beg for forgiveness.&quot;<br>
The guy with a gap in his teeth looked surprised while the other two grinned.<br>
&quot;You still in junior high, right? You should learn to respect your elders,&quot; the guy said and grabbed Shinji by the shoulder.<br>
He kneed Shinji in the stomach.<br>
Shinji tightened his stomach muscles to take the blow.<br>
It didn't hurt that much.<br>
It was just a threatening knee kick.<br>
These guys could never take on someone their own age.<br>
Shinji calmly pushed the high school student away.<br>
Then he said, &quot;What was that? A Russian hug?&quot;<br>
The guys probably didn't even know where Russia was.<br>
But the guy with the gap in his teeth seemed irked by Shinji's tone of voice, and his thin, ugly face contorted.<br>
&quot;That's it.&quot; He punched Shinji in the face.<br>
This also didn't hurt much, though the inside of Shinji's mouth got cut.<br>
Shinji stuck his fingers in his mouth to check the wound.<br>
It stung a little.<br>
He pulled out his fingers and found blood on them.<br>
It was nothing.<br>
&quot;Come on, give us your wallet.&quot;<br>
Still looking down, Shinji broke into a grin.<br>
He looked up.<br>
When their eyes met the guy with the gap in his teeth looked intimidated.<br>
Shinji said playfully, &quot;You made the first move,&quot; and then with the motion of a short hook punch he swung the hardcover imported book in his hand into the guy's filthy mouth.<br>
He felt the guy's teeth break, his head fly back.<br>
It took ten seconds for the fight to end.<br>
Of course his uncle's teachings had included fighting lessons too.<br>
It was trivial.<br>
What wasn't trivial was something else.<br>
As he glared at the passers by who were staring at the high school students on the ground, Shinji headed back to the book store and found Keita in the comics section.<br>
The book he went back for was already in a shopping bag.<br>
He seemed to be browsing aimlessly, and when Shinji called on him, he said, &quot;I'm sorry.<br>
I remembered there was another book I wanted…&quot; Then his eyes opened wide and he asked him,<br>
&quot;What happened to your mouth?&quot;<br>
Shinji shrugged and said, &quot;Let's go home.&quot; He knew though that Keita had actually turned the street corner for a split second and ducked back when he saw Shinji surrounded by three high school students.<br>
Shinji had thought Keita might have gone to call the police.<br>
(Well, given how they were so occupied with the suppression of civilians instead of criminals they weren't all that dependable anyway.) Oh, so there was another book you wanted.<br>
I see.<br>
Thanks to this incident, the train ride back to Shiroiwa-cho wasn't much fun.<br>
Keita probably thought Shinji could take on three high school students without any problem.<br>
And he was right.<br>
Keita probably didn't want to get hurt by getting involved in the fight.<br>
And okay, Shinji could understand how the high school students might take note of Keita's face if he'd called the cops.<br>
Uh huh.<br>
And Keita had no intention of apologizing to Shinji.<br>
Sometimes you need to lie to make the world go around.<br>
These things happen.<br>
As his uncle often used to say, cowards can't be faulted for being sly.<br>
They can't be held responsible for everything.<br>
But the cover was torn on the technical book Shinji bought.<br>
On top of that, the edge was stained with the guy's saliva and dented by his teeth.<br>
That really got Shinji.<br>
Every time he'd open that book he'd have to recall that annoying face.<br>
On top of that, and he might be called anal retentive for this, but he hated it when his books were torn or dirty.<br>
He always put covers on them when he read them.<br>
His uncle also said this.<br>
When you can't accept the results, then you have to punish whoever was responsible for them.<br>
Even the score.<br>
So from then on as a form of punishment Shinji decided to keep his distance from Keita.<br>
It wasn't such a severe punishment.<br>
After all, it wasn't like he decided they were enemies.<br>
They were both better off this way.<br>
So it was a trivial story.<br>
And he'd never shared the incident with Yutaka.<br>
But maybe trivializing a story like that one could get you killed in this game.<br>
This isn't revenge, Uncle.<br>
This is what you'd call the real world.<br>
I simply can't be friends with him.<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot; In response to Yutaka's statement, Keita Iijima spread his arms.<br>
The kitchen knife in his right hand reflected the moonlight.<br>
&quot;I thought we were friends.&quot;<br>
Shinji still refused to lower the muzzle of his gun.<br>
Seeing how adamant Shinji was, Keita looked like he was about to burst into tears.<br>
He threw the kitchen knife onto the ground.<br>
&quot;See? I don't want to fight.<br>
Do you see now?&quot;<br>
Shinji shook his head.<br>
&quot;No.<br>
Scram.&quot;<br>
Keita's face flushed with anger.<br>
&quot;Why? Why won't you trust me?&quot;<br>
&quot;Shinji—&quot;<br>
&quot;Shut up, Yutaka.&quot;<br>
Keita's face froze.<br>
He turned quiet…and then said, his voice trembling, &quot;Is it because of what I did that time, Shinji? When I ran off? Is that why you don't trust me, Shinji?&quot;<br>
Shinji aimed the gun at him without a word.<br>
&quot;Shinji…&quot; Keita's voice once again turned pathetic.<br>
He was practically sobbing, &quot;I'm sorry about that Shinji.<br>
I'm so sorry, Shinji—&quot;<br>
Shinji's lips tightened.<br>
He wondered whether Keita was being sincere or whether he putting on an act.<br>
But then he dismissed the thought.<br>
I'm not alone.<br>
I can't risk Yutaka's life too.<br>
There was an aphorism he'd heard claimed by a Defense Minister of some nation, &quot;We must defend ourselves according to our opponents' ability, not their intentions.&quot; They were approaching 1 a.m.<br>
&quot;Shinji, what is going on—&quot;<br>
Shinji held Yutaka back with his right hand.<br>
Keita proceeded forward.<br>
&quot;Please.<br>
I'm so scared.<br>
Please let me join.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't come any closer!&quot; Shinji shouted.<br>
Keita Iijima shook his sad face left and right and stepped out.<br>
He was approaching Shinji and Yutaka.<br>
Shinji pointed the gun downward and pulled the trigger for the first time.<br>
The shell popping out of the Beretta traced a pale white arc in the moonlight and a cloud of dust rose in front Keita's feet.<br>
Keita stared at it as if it were some rare chemistry experiment.<br>
But then he started walking again.<br>
&quot;Stop! Just stop!&quot;<br>
&quot;Please let me join.<br>
Please.&quot;<br>
Like a wind-up doll Keita stepped forward.<br>
Right, left, right.<br>
Shinji clenched his teeth.<br>
If Keita was going to pull out something besides his knife, it would have to come from his right arm.<br>
Can you aim well? This time it won't be a threat.<br>
Accurately?<br>
Of course.<br>
There was no time left.<br>
Shinji pulled the trigger again.<br>
He felt his finger slip.<br>
A split second before the popping sound, Shinji suddenly realized that he was sweating.<br>
He was sweating from the tension.<br>
It happened so suddenly.<br>
Keita Iijima bent over as if his upper body had been punched in.<br>
He spread out his arms like a shotputter does right before throwing a shot, then bent his knees and fell on his back.<br>
Even in the dark Shinji could clearly see the blood spurting out of the hole in the right side of his chest like a small fountain.<br>
This was also instantaneous.<br>
&quot;Shinji! What'd you do!&quot; Yutaka screamed and ran to Keita.<br>
He knelt beside him and put his hands on Keita's body, his mouth agape.<br>
Then after hesitating for a moment he touched his neck.<br>
His face went pale.<br>
&quot;He's dead....&quot;<br>
Shinji remained frozen, still holding onto his gun.<br>
He felt like he wasn't thinking, but he was.<br>
How lame, the voice echoed in his head.<br>
Although it was irrelevant, the voice echoed the way it does when you talk to yourself in the shower.<br>
How lame.<br>
I thought you were supposed to be The Third Man, Shinji Mimura, who never missed a shot.<br>
The star shooting guard of Shiroiwa Junior High, Shinji Mimura, right?<br>
Shinji stood up and began to walk forward.<br>
As if he'd suddenly turned into a cyborg, his body felt heavy.<br>
One day Shinji Mimura woke up to find out that he had become the Terminator.<br>
Great.<br>
He slowly walked over to Keita Iijima's body.<br>
Yutaka glared back at Shinji.<br>
&quot;Why, Shinji! Why'd you kill him!?&quot;<br>
Standing motionless, Shinji answered, &quot;I thought we'd be in trouble if Keita had another weapon besides the knife.<br>
I aimed for his arm.<br>
I didn't mean to kill him.&quot;<br>
Hearing this, Yutaka checked Keita Iijima's body.<br>
As if to make a point, he looked through Keita's day pack too.<br>
Then he said, &quot;He had nothing! How could you, Shinji!? Why didn't you trust him!?&quot;<br>
Shinji suddenly felt hollow.<br>
But…it was necessary.<br>
Hey, Uncle, I didn't do anything wrong, did I? Right?<br>
Shinji looked down at Yutaka without saying a word.<br>
But—that's right—they had to hurry.<br>
They couldn't let their mistakes drag them down.<br>
Right before he was about to say this, something changed in Yutaka's face.<br>
His lips trembled.<br>
He said, &quot;Oh no, Shinji, don't tell me you—&quot;<br>
Shinji had no idea what he was referring to.<br>
He asked, &quot;What?&quot;<br>
Yutaka quickly stepped back.<br>
He distanced himself from Shinji.<br>
Yutaka spoke through his trembling lips, &quot;Shinji, you didn't do that on purpose—&quot;<br>
Shinji's lips tightened.<br>
He gripped the Beretta in his left hand.<br>
&quot;You're saying I shot Keita to buy us time? That's...&quot;<br>
Yutaka frantically shook his head.<br>
Then he slowly retreated.<br>
&quot;No…no…this whole plan—&quot;<br>
Shinji knit his brows and stared at Yutaka.<br>
Yutaka, what is it you're getting at?<br>
&quot;This whole thing about our escape, that was just, that was—&quot;<br>
Yutaka still didn't make any sense, but Shinji whose brain's CPU was amazingly fast finally had understood what Yutaka was thinking.<br>
No, it can't be—<br>
But what else could it be?<br>
Yutaka was accusing Shinji of having no intention whatsoever to escape, that he had been planning all along to &quot;play&quot; this game.<br>
That's why he shot Keita.<br>
Shinji's face gave a look of absolute dismay.<br>
His mouth might have been hanging open for all he knew.<br>
Then he shouted, &quot;Don't be stupid! Why the hell would I be with you then!?&quot;<br>
Yutaka was trembling, shaking his head.<br>
&quot;That's… that's…&quot;<br>
Yutaka didn't say anymore, but Shinji understood that too.<br>
He probably wanted to say that Shinji was using him to survive, for instance by having him keep watch so Shinji could sleep.<br>
But waitasec here, I used the laptop to take on Sakamochi, and even after that failed, I came up with this other plan.<br>
So you're saying since I'm smart I was playing around with the cell phone and laptop to gain your trust and that my hidden intention was to use the gasoline and fertilizer to protect myself and win the game.<br>
That since I only had one gun, a special explosive would come in handy to survive in this game? That right before executing the plan to bomb the school I was going to say, &quot;Nah, let's not&quot;? Just like how I'd said,<br>
&quot;It's not working&quot; when I was computer hacking? Look, waitasec though, what about that wire we installed by the school? Are you saying I wanted to start a wire-can phone business on this island where all the phone circuits have been shut off? Or you're just saying that was another act? Or that I had some plan you couldn't even conceive of?<br>
When I said I'd help out after you told me you were going to avenge Izumi Kanai's death, you cried.<br>
So my response was another deception?<br>
That's too much, Yutaka.<br>
I mean there's no end to suspicion once you get going.<br>
But you're going too far.<br>
This is absurd.<br>
Really, it's hilarious.<br>
Funnier than your jokes.<br>
Maybe you're losing it from fatigue.<br>
That's what Shinji thought on a rational level.<br>
And if he could have gone through each explanation step by step then Yutaka would have realized how foolish every one of his suspicions were.<br>
In fact, everything Shinji could come up with might not have corresponded to Yutaka's suspicions.<br>
It might have been a simple case of fatigue combined with the shock of witnessing his close friend die suddenly giving way to a suspicion lurking somewhere in the back of Yutaka's mind.<br>
But…it came to surface because it had been there in the first place, his suspicion towards Shinji.<br>
And the thought of suspecting Yutaka had never even occurred to Shinji.<br>
All of a sudden, the exhaustion he felt was overpowering.<br>
A horizontal twelve-cylinder turbo engine.<br>
This level of exhaustion is top-class, yessir, it really is a steal, sir.<br>
Shinji uncocked the Beretta and tossed it over to Yutaka.<br>
Yutaka hesitated but received it.<br>
Emptied out, Shinji threw his hands onto his knees.<br>
&quot;If you don't trust me then shoot me, Yutaka.<br>
I don't care, just shoot me.&quot; Crouching, Shinji continued, &quot;I shot Keita to protect you, Yutaka.<br>
Damn.&quot;<br>
Yutaka suddenly looked at him blankly.<br>
Then ready to burst into tears, he uttered, &quot;Oh…oh…&quot; He ran to Shinji.<br>
Yutaka put his hand on Shinji's shoulder and began sobbing out loud.<br>
Shinji stared down at the ground with his hands on his knees.<br>
He realized his eyes too were filled with tears.<br>
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he was telling himself, hey hey, don't you have more urgent matters to attend to? Look how vulnerable you guys are bickering like this.<br>
Have you forgotten, you're surrounded by enemies? Look at your watch for crying out loud, you're out of time…the voice resembled his uncle's.<br>
But Shinji's nerves were too worn out, his body too tired, and emotions too rattled from Yutaka's suspicion against him to take heed of this warning.<br>
He merely cried.<br>
Yutaka.<br>
I was trying to protect you.<br>
How could you suspect me? I trusted you…but then again, maybe Keita Iijima felt the same way.<br>
How horrible to be suspected by someone you trust.<br>
I did an awful thing.<br>
Amidst these worn out emotions of sadness, exhaustion, and regret, Shinji heard a rattling that sounded like the tapping of an old typewriter.<br>
A split second later, he felt as if burnt tongs were poking through his body.<br>
The wounds were fatal by then, but the pain made Shinji come to his senses.<br>
Yutaka, who had his hand on Shinji's shoulder, fell to the ground.<br>
Over at the far end of the farm coop parking lot was a figure in a school coat.<br>
He held a gun—something bigger than a pistol.<br>
It looked more like a tin box.<br>
Shinji realized he'd been shot—of course with bullets, damn—with bullets that had exited through Yutaka's body.<br>
His body felt hot and stiff (the guy just lanced me with lead bullets, duh), but Shinji reflexively fell to his left and picked up the Beretta Yutaka had taken and dropped.<br>
He aimed it at the figure, Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No.<br>
6) and fired several times at his stomach.<br>
Kazuo Kiriyama shifted to the right before the shots got to him, though.<br>
Then along with the rattling sound, the tips of his hands flashed like out-of-season fireworks.<br>
The blows he felt in the right side of his stomach, his left shoulder, and chest were much worse than the one he'd just felt a moment ago.<br>
The Beretta fell from his hand.<br>
But by then Shinji had already begun running toward the farm coop.<br>
He staggered for a moment, but then crouched down and dashed off, leaping through the sliding door head first.<br>
A stream of bullets chased after him and right when Shinji thought he'd escaped them, it managed to blow off the tip of his right foot's basketball sneaker.<br>
This time Shinji grimaced in agony from the pain shooting through his body.<br>
But he had no time to rest.<br>
He grabbed the gas can in the shadow of the sliding door and retreated through the dark where the tractor and combine harvester were, practically crawling on his left arm and left leg.<br>
He dragged the gas can with his right hand.<br>
Blood was pouring out of his mouth.<br>
There were at least ten bullets in his body.<br>
And despite the sharp pain that shot up from his right foot he managed to glance at the vanished tip of his basketball shoes and thought, I guess I can't play ball anymore.<br>
Impossible now.<br>
Even if I could I'll never be in the starting lineup.<br>
So much for my basketball career.<br>
But Shinji was more concerned about Yutaka.<br>
Could he still be alive?<br>
Kazuo—Shinji coughed up blood as he clenched his teeth—so you've decided to play the game, you bastard.<br>
Then come after me.<br>
Yutaka can't move, but I can.<br>
You can take care of Yutaka later.<br>
First come after me.<br>
Come on, come after me.<br>
As if responding to his wish, Shinji could see from underneath the tractor a figure in the blue pale belt of light coming in through the sliding door.<br>
Then along with the rattling sound, lights flashed like camera flashes, and bullets scattered across the building.<br>
A part of some farm equipment was blown to bits, and the window across from him was smashed into fragments.<br>
It stopped.<br>
He was out of bullets.<br>
But Kazuo would reload another magazine.<br>
Shinji grabbed a screwdriver near him and tossed it to his left.<br>
It made a clanging sound and tapped onto the floor.<br>
He thought Kazuo would shoot over there, but instead he scattered bullets across in an arc around the screwdriver.<br>
Shinji ducked, praying he wouldn't be hit.<br>
The shooting stopped again.<br>
Shinji looked up.<br>
Now…he could tell Kazuo was inside the building.<br>
That's right, Shinji's blood-drenched lips formed a smile.<br>
I'm over here.<br>
Come over here—<br>
Shinji lifted the gas can with his right hand and placed it on his stomach.<br>
He moved back again with his left arm and left leg, trying his best not to make any sound.<br>
His back hit a hard, boxlike object, and he slid around it as he continued to retreat.<br>
His movements weren't completely silent.<br>
Kazuo already knew he was hiding somewhere in the dark here.<br>
The blood dripping out of him was a dead giveaway.<br>
Kazuo crouched down and checked under various farm tools and the pickup truck as he approached Shinji.<br>
Shinji surveyed the area.<br>
He could barely make out the outline of the upper floor on the opposite side of the building as well as the steel stairs that led up there from the door.<br>
If his body was in adequate condition he could have jumped on him from up there.<br>
But that wasn't possible anymore.<br>
There was a cart on the east wall.<br>
It was a pushcart with four small wheels used to carry equipment.<br>
The office in the corner with partitions was beyond the pushcart and next to it was an exit.<br>
The sliding door, if fully opened, was large enough for a car, but this one was only for people.<br>
The door was shut.<br>
That door…1 locked it along with the other windows and every other door.<br>
How long would it take me to unlock it?<br>
He had no time to think it over.<br>
Shinji dragged his body over to the pushcart.<br>
Once he was there he placed the gas can on it.<br>
He opened its lid.<br>
He pushed in the rubber object dangling from a plastic cord.<br>
He took out the detonation device in his pocket.<br>
His fingers were clumsy—probably due to his wounds—but they finally managed to peel off the tape on the side of the battery, revealing an exposed wire dangling from the detonator tube.<br>
Shinji connected it to the wire tip of the condenser circuit.<br>
He pulled off the insulation of the battery case.<br>
As he heard a faint, high hum from the rapid charge of the condenser, he quickly peeled off the tape on the charge device switch and shoved the detonator tube deep inside the gas can's rubber cap.<br>
He left the rest of the unit, including the charge device, the battery case, and circuit, on top of the gas can.<br>
He had no time to secure it.<br>
He could see Kazuo's feet to the right of the threshing machine.<br>
His chances were slim.<br>
But now that Yutaka and me are injured there's no way we'll ever make it up the mountain.<br>
So…<br>
…here's a special something for you, Kazuo.<br>
Shinji kicked the pushcart with his left leg as hard as he could.<br>
As the cart skimmed by the other equipment, Shinji leaped for the exit door without even checking to see if the cart was heading towards Kazuo.<br>
He unlocked it in 0.2 seconds.<br>
He even utilized his right leg with its missing foot tip to crash through the door and leap out of the building.<br>
The slate walls of the farm coop behind him suddenly burst with an explosion that shook the entire dark island.<br>
The sound of Kazuo's hand grenade that had temporarily disabled Shuya's hearing was nothing compared to this explosion.<br>
Shinji realized, whoa, there go my eardrums.<br>
His body slid on the ground from the blast of the explosion, scraping off the skin on his forehead.<br>
Fragments and scraps blew by.<br>
Still, Shinji managed to look back quickly and see, right where the building's wall should be, the light truck floating in the air upside down.<br>
Probably due to its raised position from the jack, the blast had slammed it with incredible pressure, blowing it upwards.<br>
It spun around slowly in air filled with fragments of glass, slate, and concrete (he felt as if they were also stuck into his body too, but the ones he saw now didn't come flying out directly, but were blown up into the sky), traced an exaggerated arc, and crashed on its side in the middle of the parking lot.<br>
It rolled over another ninety degrees and stopped, completely upside down.<br>
The back carriage was nearly torn off, twisted up like a wrung out rag, and the wheel with a missing tire somehow managed to still spin around and around.<br>
Fragments continued showering down.<br>
Immersed in clouds of smoke the farm coop was now reduced to only its frame.<br>
The only wall remaining was part of the one on the north side, along with the upper floor.<br>
But the upper floor was completely exposed behind the smoke.<br>
The south side of the roof was completely blown away, and the machines, including the farm equipment, were scattered around on their sides.<br>
Even in the dark Shinji could tell they were burnt black.<br>
He saw several bright flames.<br>
Maybe something was on fire.<br>
The side exit Shinji used to escape through was barely connected to the remains of the wall by the bottom hinges, bent over his way, as if bowing.<br>
The office with partitions had completely vanished without a trace.<br>
Well, actually there was the office desk still hanging on, glued to the part of the wall that escaped destruction, pushed from behind by the combine harvester that was also probably blown away by the explosion.<br>
Something must have been blown up high in the sky because, completely out of sync with the other debris, it was finally landing somewhere in the smoke with a high metallic ring.<br>
Although Shinji could hardly hear it.<br>
Next thing he knew, Shinji was struggling to get up from the debris of wall and other materials, staring at the ruins of the building.<br>
He gasped.<br>
Yes, the handmade gasoline can bomb was well made.<br>
With that kind of destructive force it would have certainly annihilated the school.<br>
But that was all over now.<br>
The important thing now was that he'd defeated the enemy coming after him.<br>
And even more urgent was—<br>
&quot;Yutaka…&quot;<br>
He mumbled as he finally got up, kneeling on his right knee on the debris.<br>
The moment he opened his mouth, blood came gushing out between his teeth, and he felt an incredible surge of pain running from his chest down to his stomach.<br>
It was a miracle he was still alive.<br>
But he stretched out his arms and put his right leg down on its heel and then stretched out his left leg and somehow managed to stand up.<br>
Shinji looked over to the edge of the parking lot where Yutaka was lying…<br>
…when he saw the overturned light truck's door—it must have been busted—open with a dull creaking sound.<br>
(He could hear it faintly.<br>
Some of his hearing seemed to be coming back.) Kazuo Kiriyama stepped down onto the ground.<br>
He held the tin-box-like machine gun in his right hand as if nothing had happened.<br>
Hey—<br>
Shinji felt like he should burst out laughing.<br>
For all he knew his blood-soaked lips might have even formed a smile.<br>
You gotta be kidding.<br>
By then Kazuo fired.<br>
Shinji this time met a full frontal parabolic shower of 9mm bullets and staggered back into the ground covered with debris.<br>
Something was pressing into his back.<br>
As of now there really was no need to check it, but he thought it was the front of the parked station wagon.<br>
The station wagon had also been blown up by the blast, its back stuck into a wooden telephone pole now lopsided from the impact.<br>
Another object seemed to have smashed into its windshield, which resembled a spider's web.<br>
Surrounded by the bright flames burning in the building, Kazuo calmly stood still.<br>
Then beyond him Shinji saw Yutaka lying on his face, half buried in the debris.<br>
Right near him was Keita Iijima lying on his back, his face staring at Shinji.<br>
He thought, Kazuo, damn, so I ended up losing to you.<br>
He thought, I'm sorry Yutaka, I let my guard down for a moment.<br>
He thought, Uncle, how lame, huh?<br>
He thought, Ikumi, fall in love and be happy.<br>
Looks like I won't be able to…looks like.<br>
..<br>
Kazuo Kiriyama's Ingram burst out once again and Shinji's thoughts came to an end.<br>
The bullets had torn apart his cerebral cortex.<br>
Near his head, the cracked front windshield was now shattered, most of its fragments sliding into the car, but some of the finer mistlike particles fell on Shinji's body already covered with dust and debris.<br>
Shinji slowly fell forward on his face.<br>
Debris bounced up on impact.<br>
It took less than thirty seconds for the rest of his body besides his brain to die.<br>
The memento of his beloved uncle—the earring worn by the woman he loved—was now stained in blood running down Shinji's left ear, reflecting the glow from the building now consumed in red flames.<br>
And so the boy known as The Third Man, Shinji Mimura, was now dead.<br>
17 students remaining<br>
PART THREE<br>
FINAL STAGE<br>
17 students remaining<br>
52<br>
In the bushes with her blanket over her shoulders, Noriko hugged her knees and stared at the ground.<br>
It was still very dark and insects were humming the way a fluorescent light sputters out before it dies.<br>
Sakamochi's midnight announcement came on right after they reached this area.<br>
He announced the death of Hirono Shimizu (Female Student No.<br>
10), who had—although Noriko herself didn't see it—killed Kaori Minami and fled from Shuya, followed by the addition of three forbidden zones.<br>
At 1 a.m.<br>
F=7, at 3 a.m.<br>
G=3, and at 5 a.m.<br>
E=4.<br>
Noriko and Shogo's sector, C=3, was still safe.<br>
Shuya's name wasn't mentioned, but…<br>
Ten to twenty minutes later, there was distant gunfire again and then the sound of that machine gun.<br>
Noriko's heart froze.<br>
The sound continued.<br>
She couldn't forget it.<br>
It was unmistakable—the sound of Kazuo Kiriyama's machine gun.<br>
Unless someone else had the same gun.<br>
Regardless, the sound was enough to make her wonder whether Kazuo had finally caught up to Shuya.<br>
Before Noriko could mention this to Shogo though, there was an incredible explosion.<br>
The hand grenade they encountered when they were fighting Kiriyama was nothing compared to this.<br>
And then there was the faint sound of the machine gun, once or twice.<br>
After that the island returned to silence.<br>
Even Shogo seemed surprised by the sound.<br>
He was carving an arrow-like object with his knife when he suddenly stopped and said, &quot;I'm going to go have a look.<br>
Don't move,&quot; and walked out of the bushes.<br>
He came back immediately and told her, &quot;A building's on fire on the east side.&quot;<br>
Noriko started to ask, &quot;Could it be?…&quot; but Shogo shook his head and said, &quot;It's quite a ways south from where Kiriyama was.<br>
Shuya escaped into the mountainside, so it can't be him.<br>
Let's wait for him here.&quot;<br>
Noriko felt relieved for the time being.<br>
But nearly an entire hour had passed since then.<br>
Shuya still hadn't returned.<br>
Noriko held her wrist under the coin-sized moonlight coming through the branches and checked her watch.<br>
It was 1:12 a.m.<br>
She'd been repeating this gesture as if it were a magical ritual.<br>
Then she buried her head between her knees.<br>
A horrible image flashed by in her thoughts.<br>
Shuya's face.<br>
His mouth half-open and eyes looking off into the distance, the way he looked singing a song called &quot;Imagine&quot; (Shuya said it was a rock standard) during one of their breaks in the music room, out of the teacher's sight.<br>
But this face had a large, black dot similar to one worn by a Hindu worshipper.<br>
Without warning, red liquid came oozing out of the dot.<br>
The large dot was in fact a very dark and deep hole.<br>
The blood poured out from his brain, covering his face…like cracks running through a piece of glass__<br>
Noriko shivered and shook her head, dismissing the thought.<br>
She looked up at Shogo, who was leaning against a tree trunk, smoking a cigarette.<br>
There was a handmade bow next to him and several arrows stuck in the ground.<br>
&quot;Shogo.&quot;<br>
He looked like a silhouette in the dark.<br>
He removed the cigarette from his mouth and rested his right wrist on his upright knee.<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
&quot;Shuya should be here by now.&quot;<br>
He put his cigarette in his mouth again.<br>
Its tip reddened, faintly lighting up his calm face.<br>
Noriko felt impatient.<br>
His face darkened again and smoke drifted out of his mouth.<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
His calm tone also irritated her.<br>
But then she reminded herself how he'd saved her and Shuya several times over, so she restrained herself.<br>
&quot;Something must have…happened.&quot;<br>
&quot;Probably.&quot;<br>
&quot;What do you mean, 'probably'?&quot;<br>
His silhouette raised its arms.<br>
The lit cigarette moved.<br>
&quot;Calm down.<br>
That was definitely Kazuo's machine gun.<br>
Unless they supplied an identical machine gun to someone else.<br>
And given how the explosion occurred over there, it means that Kazuo was fighting someone besides Shuya.<br>
Shuya escaped from Kazuo.<br>
I know that much.&quot;<br>
&quot;But then why isn't he—&quot;<br>
He interrupted, &quot;He's probably hiding somewhere.<br>
Or he might have gotten lost.&quot;<br>
She shook her head.<br>
&quot;He might be hurt.<br>
Or even worse…&quot;<br>
She felt a chill run down her spine.<br>
She couldn't continue.<br>
The image of Shuya with the red spider-web face and half-open mouth flashed by again.<br>
Shuya might have escaped from Kazuo, but he might have been severely wounded, he might be dying right now.<br>
Even if that wasn't the case, what if he was attacked by someone while he was running through the mountains… or what if he fell unconscious somewhere, and what if that was in a forbidden zone, then Shuya would end up dead.<br>
That's right…Shuya might have run into the base of the northern mountain which was in sector F=7, directly north of the school, sector F=7 which was a forbidden zone as of 1 a.m.<br>
And now it was past 1 a.m.<br>
Which meant…<br>
She shook her head again.<br>
That couldn't be.<br>
Shuya couldn't die.<br>
Because…Shuya was like a holy man with a guitar.<br>
He was always kind to everyone, he was always so sympathetic to the sorrows of others, but he would never lose that powerful smile, he was so upright and transparent and innocent but also tough.<br>
He's like my guardian angel.<br>
How could someone like that die? There's no way he could…but still…<br>
Shogo quietly said, &quot;He might be, he might not be.&quot;<br>
She turned her wrist and nervously checked her watch again.<br>
She moved her leg painfully and sidled up to Shogo.<br>
She squeezed Shogo's left hand, which was on his knees, with both hands.<br>
&quot;Please.<br>
Can't we go…can't we go look for him? Will you come with me? I can't do this on my own.<br>
Please.&quot;<br>
Shogo said nothing.<br>
He only lifted his left hand slowly, returning Noriko's hands to her thighs, and tapped them lightly.<br>
&quot;We can't.<br>
Even if you insist on going alone, I won't let you.<br>
Shuya wanted me to look after you.<br>
He took a big risk making us leave before him.<br>
I don't want to jeopardize all he did for us.&quot;<br>
She bit her lower lip and stared at him.<br>
&quot;Don't give me that look.<br>
You're making this hard on me.&quot; Shogo scratched his head with his hand holding his cigarette and said, &quot;You care about Shuya, right?&quot;<br>
She nodded.<br>
She didn't hesitate.<br>
He nodded back and said, &quot;Then let's respect his wishes.&quot;<br>
She bit her lip again, but then looked down and nodded.<br>
&quot;All right.<br>
We can only wait, right?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot; He nodded.<br>
They were silent for a while but then he asked, &quot;Do you believe in sixth sense?&quot;<br>
The topic was so unexpected Noriko widened her eyes.<br>
Was he trying to distract her?<br>
&quot;Well…a little.<br>
I don't really know though,&quot; she responded.<br>
&quot;Do you?&quot;<br>
He crushed his cigarette into the ground.<br>
Then he said, &quot;Absolutely not…well, I don't think it matters either way.<br>
All that stuff about ghosts, the afterlife, cosmic power, sixth sense, fortune telling, psychic powers, that's just the talk of fools who can only deal with reality by avoiding it.<br>
I'm sorry.<br>
You said you believed a little.<br>
That's just my opinion.<br>
But...&quot;<br>
She looked at his eyes.<br>
&quot;But?&quot;<br>
&quot;But sometimes without any apparent reason I'm certain about things I can't know for sure.<br>
And for some reason I've never been wrong when this happens.&quot;<br>
She remained silent and stared at him.<br>
He said, &quot;Shuya's still alive.<br>
He'll be back.<br>
I know it.&quot;<br>
Her face suddenly relaxed.<br>
He might have been making this up on the spot, but even so she was touched he made the effort.<br>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, &quot;You're kind, Shogo.&quot;<br>
He shrugged.<br>
&quot;I'm just telling you how I feel.&quot; Then he said, &quot;Shuya's a lucky guy.&quot;<br>
She looked over at him.<br>
&quot;Hm?&quot;<br>
&quot;Lucky that someone loves him this much.&quot;<br>
She smiled just a little.<br>
&quot;You got it wrong.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's unrequited.<br>
Shuya likes someone else.<br>
I'm nothing compared to her.&quot;<br>
&quot;…really?&quot;<br>
She looked down and nodded.<br>
&quot;She's really awesome.<br>
I don't know how to describe her.<br>
She's so strong and beautiful.<br>
I'm jealous, but I can understand why he's attracted to her.&quot;<br>
He tilted his head and said, &quot;I don't know.&quot; He flicked his lighter several times and lit another cigarette and added, &quot;I think Shuya cares about you now.&quot;<br>
She shook her head.<br>
&quot;Oh no.&quot;<br>
&quot;When he comes back,&quot; he smiled, &quot;you should let him have it, call him a jerk for making you worry like this.&quot;<br>
She smiled a little again.<br>
He blew out smoke.<br>
&quot;Now lie down.<br>
You haven't fully recovered yet.<br>
Once you're drowsy, get some sleep.<br>
I'll stay up all night.<br>
If Shuya shows up, I'll tell him to wake the princess with a kiss.&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; She smiled and nodded.<br>
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br>
She still sat up another ten minutes.<br>
Then she wrapped herself in the blanket and lay down.<br>
She still couldn't sleep though.<br>

Hiroki Sugimura was getting exhausted.<br>
He'd been walking without stopping ever since the game began, so it was only natural.<br>
But every time he heard Sakamochi's announcement, his level of exhaustion rose as if he were climbing a staircase.<br>
Now only twenty were left…no, as far as Hiroki knew, the number was down to seventeen.<br>
It was hard to believe, but Shinji Mimura was dead, along with Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima.<br>
After he left Shuya's group at the clinic, Hiroki headed towards the island's northwest shore, which he'd never checked out.<br>
Then a little past 11 p.m.<br>
he heard heavy gunfire and moved back east of the island's central area in pursuit of the sound.<br>
But the noise stopped before he got there, so he couldn't find anything.<br>
Then the midnight announcement came, and the additional forbidden zones were announced.<br>
Hiroki decided to comb through each of those zones.<br>
As he was entering the north side of the school, sector F=7, which would be forbidden at 1 a.m., he heard a gunshot and then…that machine gun sound.<br>
Because he was in the mountain, looking over the flat area, Hiroki saw a repeating flash, what seemed like a muzzle flashing in the farm immediately west of the housing area.<br>
As he descended the slope he heard an ear-shattering explosion.<br>
The night sky above the trees lit up.<br>
Then he heard the rattling sound again.<br>
As he left the foot of the mountain, he saw a building on fire where the light had been flashing.<br>
Hiroki thought the assailant with the machine gun might still be there, but as he'd done with Megumi Eto, he had to find out what happened.<br>
He cautiously wove his way through the farm, approaching the area where…<br>
…he found the body of Shinji Mimura.<br>
The area was flickering with flames.<br>
The warehouse building—that must have been what exploded—was blown apart.<br>
Large and small debris were scattered all over what appeared to be a parking lot.<br>
Shinji was lying face down in front of a station wagon in the lot.<br>
His body was riddled with bullets.<br>
Later Hiroki found the bodies of Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima in the debris.<br>
There was no trace of the assailant with the machine gun, but Hiroki thought it was likely someone who was &quot;playing the game&quot; would show up soon, so he quickly left the area.<br>
It was only after he'd crossed the island's latitudinal road and entered the base of the southern mountain that he thought about Shinji, the death of the Shinji Mimura.<br>
There was something unbelievable about it, since Hiroki knew him pretty well.<br>
It sounded offensive now, but he'd always thought Shinji was immortal.<br>
Hiroki went to the town martial arts school and learned martial arts, but that in the end was just a matter of technique.<br>
It was nothing against Shinji's inborn athletic prowess.<br>
Even if they'd fought according to martial arts rules, and even though Hiroki was ten centimeters taller, Shinji would have easily defeated him in a match.<br>
Besides, Shinji was much smarter than him.<br>
Even if Shinji couldn't escape the game (although it was likely he'd considered it), Hiroki firmly believed no one else would be able to kill Shinji.<br>
And yet the machine gun shooter somehow managed to do just that.<br>
He couldn't afford to mourn over Shinji, though.<br>
What mattered now was finding Kayoko Kotohiki.<br>
He had to find her soon—if the machine gun shooter found her, someone like Kotohiki would get instantly killed.<br>
Since sector G=3, forbidden at 3 a.m., was on the northern side of the southern mountain peak, Hiroki decided to head over there.<br>
He'd already entered this mountain several times now.<br>
Takako Chigusa's body was still lying in sector H=4 in the region right before sector G=3.<br>
He couldn't even bury her body.<br>
He'd only managed to close her eyes and cross her arms over her chest.<br>
Her body was still outside the forbidden zone.<br>
As he cautiously moved forward through the darkness, Hiroki thought, I'm so awful.<br>
He wasn't even able to stay by his closest childhood friend.<br>
He'd probably be walking by her as he headed towards sector G=3.<br>
I'm so sorry, Takako.<br>
I still need to take care of something.<br>
Right now I just have to see Kayoko Kotohiki.<br>
Please forgive me…<br>
Then something else occurred to him.<br>
It concerned Yutaka Seto.<br>
Yutaka's seating number immediately followed his, so Yutaka had exited right after Hiroki.<br>
But Hiroki was still in the middle of checking out the premises, frantically searching for a hiding place that gave him a clear look at the school exit, so Yutaka was gone by the time he could afford to look back.<br>
Hiroki decided Takako would be his priority, and so he let Haruka Tanizawa (Female Student No.<br>
12) and Yuichiro Takiguchi (Male Student No.<br>
13) pass by.<br>
(But in spite of his extreme caution, Yoshio Akamatsu's surprise appearance had made him panic enough to lose Takako.) Yutaka had managed to join up with his friends Shinji Mimura and Keita Iijima.<br>
But Yutaka was now dead along with Shinji.<br>
I have to hurry, he thought.<br>
I can't let Kotohiki die.<br>
He stopped by a bare tree and checked the radar in his left hand again.<br>
With the moon providing the only source of light, the unlit liquid crystal display was difficult to read, but by squinting his eyes he found he could make out faint traces of the crystal particles.<br>
Nothing changed on the screen, though.<br>
There was only the star mark indicating his position.<br>
Hiroki sighed.<br>
Maybe he should just shout for Kotohiki.<br>
Hiroki had considered doing this several times, but then decided against it.<br>
When he found Takako, it had been too late.<br>
He didn't want that to happen again.<br>
No.<br>
It wouldn't work.<br>
He couldn't.<br>
First of all, Kotohiki wouldn't necessarily respond to his call.<br>
In fact, she might run away.<br>
Furthermore, although he didn't care about someone coming after him once he called for her, if Kotohiki were to come at the same time she might end up getting attacked.<br>
In the end, he could only rely on the government-supplied radar.<br>
And without this equipment, he would have been even worse off.<br>
He absolutely despised the government for throwing them into this stupid game, but he had to admit he benefited from his equipment.<br>
What's this called? A stroke of luck in hard times? Or more like, a light in a tunnel of fury?<br>
He went up and down a low cliff covered in bushes and came out onto a gentle slope scattered with trees.<br>
He knew he was entering sector H=4, where Takako was resting in peace.<br>
Hiroki raised the radar, moving it slightly to catch the moonlight on the crystal display.<br>
He saw a blurred double image of the star mark indicating his position at the center of the display.<br>
Oh no, I'm getting tired.<br>
Even my vision's going now.<br>
Hiroki was still looking down when he realized he was wrong.<br>
At the same time, he turned around and swung his stick in his right hand.<br>
Following the martial arts technique he had learned so thoroughly, his elegant swing traced a graceful arc.<br>
The stick impressively landed on the arm of the figure standing behind him.<br>
The person groaned and dropped the object, a gun, in their hand.<br>
Someone had snuck up behind him when his guard was down for that brief moment.<br>
The figure made a dash for the gun on the ground.<br>
Hiroki thrust the stick out in front of him.<br>
The figure froze and then staggered back—<br>
Hiroki saw it.<br>
First, it was only the sailor suit.<br>
Then the beautiful face, brightly lit by the moon—angelic—it was unmistakably hers.<br>
It was right after he left the school, when he still hadn't managed to find a hiding place___Hiroki had been lurking in the corner of the athletic field when he saw the face of Mitsuko Souma (Female Student No.<br>
11) as she emerged from the school building after him.<br>
Mitsuko lifted both of her hands and stepped back.<br>
&quot;Please don't kill me! Please don't kill me!&quot; she shouted.<br>
She staggered and fell on her behind, revealing her white legs up beyond her thighs under her pleated skirt.<br>
She continued coquettishly to move back in the pale blue moonlight.<br>
&quot;Please! I was just trying to talk to you! I wouldn't think of killing anyone! Please help me! Help me!&quot;<br>
Hiroki looked down at her without saying a word.<br>
Maybe she'd taken his silence to be a sign he meant no harm.<br>
Mitsuko slowly lowered her hands.<br>
Her eyes had the intimidated look of a terrified mouse, and tears were gleaming in them.<br>
&quot;You believe me, don't you?&quot; she said.<br>
A ray of moonlight fell on her tearstained face.<br>
Her eyes were faintly smiling.<br>
Of course, it wasn't the proud victorious smile of deception, but a smile brimming with relief that she felt deep in her heart.<br>
&quot;I…I…&quot; she said but then pulled on her skirt with her left hand as if she'd finally realized her thighs were exposed.<br>
&quot;I thought I could trust you…so…I've been so scared…all alone…this is so awful…I'm just so terrified…&quot;<br>
Without saying a word, Hiroki picked up the gun Mitsuko had dropped.<br>
He saw it was cocked, so he uncocked the hammer with one hand and walked over to Mitsuko.<br>
He offered her the handle of the gun.<br>
&quot;Th-thankyou…&quot; Mitsuko reached out.<br>
But the gun froze.<br>
Hiroki flipped it around with his hand.<br>
Now the muzzle was pointed right between her brows.<br>
&quot;Wh-what are you doing, Hiroki?&quot;<br>
Mitsuko's face was twisted with dismay and horror—at the very least it looked contorted.<br>
She was priceless.<br>
It wouldn't matter how many sordid rumors you heard about Mitsuko Souma, most people (particularly guys) would have to believe her once this angelic face of hers pleaded for mercy.<br>
No, even if you didn't believe her, you'd still end up doing anything you could for her.<br>
By no means was Hiroki an exception.<br>
Still, he had special circumstances.<br>
&quot;Forget it, Mitsuko,&quot; Hiroki said.<br>
He held the gun and stood upright.<br>
&quot;I saw Takako right before she died.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh…&quot;<br>
She looked up at him, her perfectly shaped eyes trembling.<br>
Even if inside she was regretting not having finished Takako off, she gave no indication whatsoever of any regret.<br>
She just maintained that terrified look…a look seeking understanding and protection.<br>
&quot;N-no! That was an accident.<br>
Sure, I saw some of the others.<br>
But…when I encountered Takako…it was her… she… she tried to kill me… that gun's really Takako's…so…so I…&quot;<br>
Hiroki recocked the Colt .45 with a click.<br>
Mitsuko's eyes squinted.<br>
&quot;I know Takako.<br>
Takako would never try to kill someone, nor would she ever panic and go on a shooting spree.<br>
Even in this stupid game,&quot; Hiroki said.<br>
Mitsuko tucked in her chin.<br>
She looked up at Hiroki and formed a smile.<br>
While it sent chills down his spine, it was precisely then that Mitsuko looked even more beautiful.<br>
Ha, she faintly laughed.<br>
&quot;I thought she died instantly,&quot; she said.<br>
Hiroki didn't respond and kept pointing the gun at her.<br>
Still sitting, Mitsuko pinched the edge of her skirt with her left thumb and index finger, pulling it back slowly, once again revealing those enticing legs.<br>
Hiroki looked up.<br>
&quot;How about it? If you help me, you can do what you like with me.<br>
I'm not bad, you know.&quot;<br>
Hiroki remained frozen, holding the gun.<br>
He examined her face.<br>
&quot;I guess not,&quot; Mitsuko said.<br>
She said lightly, &quot;Of course not.<br>
I mean I'd kill you the moment you let down your guard.<br>
Besides, how could you sleep with the girl who killed your girlfriend—&quot;<br>
&quot;She's not my girlfriend.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko looked at Hiroki.<br>
Hiroki continued, &quot;But she was my best friend.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh really?&quot; Mitsuko raised her brow.<br>
Then she asked, &quot;Why won't you shoot me then? Is it because you're some kind of feminist? Can't shoot women?&quot;<br>
Her supremely confident face was still beautiful.<br>
It was totally different from Takako's, who, that's right, had the graceful beauty of a war goddess in Greek or Roman myth.<br>
Here we had a teenage sorceress.<br>
She's charming, innocent, angelic, yet completely frigid.<br>
Under the moonlight, her eyes were like gleaming ice.<br>
Hiroki felt dizzy.<br>
&quot;How…&quot; He could tell his voice was hoarse.<br>
&quot;How could you kill someone so easily?&quot;<br>
&quot;You fool,&quot; Mitsuko said.<br>
She sounded as if she could care less about the gun pointed at her forehead.<br>
&quot;Those are the rules.&quot;<br>
Hiroki squinted and shook his head.<br>
&quot;Not everyone's playing by them.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko tilted her head again.<br>
Then she said, still smiling warmly, &quot;Hiroki.&quot; It sounded so plain and friendly, the way a girl who ended up sitting next to her crush would call him, looking for some topic to bring up before homeroom began.<br>
&quot;You're probably a good person, Hiroki,&quot; she said.<br>
Hiroki didn't understand and knit his brows.<br>
His mouth might have been open.<br>
Mitsuko continued, lightly, as she were singing, &quot;Good people are good.<br>
In some respects.<br>
But even those good people can turn bad.<br>
Or maybe they end up being good their entire lives.<br>
Maybe you're one of those people.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko looked away from Hiroki and then shook her head.<br>
&quot;No, that's beside the point.<br>
I just decided to take instead of being taken.<br>
It's not a question of good or bad, wrong or right.<br>
It's just what I want to do.&quot;<br>
Hiroki's lips trembled.<br>
They were twitching uncontrollably.<br>
&quot;…why though?&quot;<br>
Mitsuko smiled again.<br>
&quot;I don't know.<br>
But if I have to come up with some explanation.<br>
Well, for starters…&quot; She looked into Hiroki's eyes and then said, &quot;I was raped when I was nine years old.<br>
Three guys taking turns, three times each, oh, wait, one of them might have done it four times.<br>
One of you did it.<br>
Although they were middle-aged men.<br>
I was just a skinny kid back then, my chest was flat, and my legs were like sticks, but that's what they wanted.<br>
And when I started screaming that only excited them more.<br>
So even now when I'm with perverted men like that I still pretend to cry.&quot;<br>
Hiroki stood frozen as he stared at Mitsuko who'd just revealed so much but continued wearing her pleasant smile.<br>
He was shocked by this devastating story.<br>
It was—<br>
Hiroki might have been on the verge of saying something.<br>
But before he could, a silver light flashed out of Mitsuko's hands.<br>
Hiroki realized Mitsuko had managed to reach behind her back with her right hand, but by then the double-bladed diver's knife (this used to be Megumi Eto's weapon) was already planted in his right shoulder.<br>
Hiroki let out a groan, and although he still held the gun, he staggered back in pain.<br>
Mitsuko instantly got up, ran past Hiroki, and into the woods behind him.<br>
Hiroki quickly looked back and caught a glimpse of her…as she vanished into the dark.<br>
He knew if he didn't kill Mitsuko Souma now then Kayoko Kotohiki might be the next one to fall into her trap.<br>
But Hiroki couldn't bring himself to do it.<br>
Instead, he pressed his left hand against his right shoulder where the blood from the knife wound began to soak through his school coat.<br>
He stared into the dark where Mitsuko had disappeared.<br>
Of course…Mitsuko might have made up that story to stall him.<br>
But Hiroki couldn't buy that.<br>
Mitsuko told him the truth.<br>
And he'd only heard…part of it.<br>
Hiroki had been puzzled over how a third-year junior high school girl his age could be so merciless.<br>
It turned out she had acquired the psyche of a grown adult a long time ago.<br>
A twisted adult's, no, maybe it was more accurate to say a twisted child's psyche?<br>
The blood oozed down his sleeve then down the Colt .45 and began dripping from the tip in a thin line, landing onto a pile of moldy leaves by his feet without a sound.<br>
17 students remaining<br>
54<br>
Slightly past 3:30 a.m., Toshinori Oda (Male Student No.<br>
4) left the house he was hiding in.<br>
Immediately after he hid there, he surmised it was inside sector E=4.<br>
Sakamochi had announced the sector would be forbidden at 5 a.m.<br>
Before he opened the back door to leave, he glanced over at Hirono Shimizu's body, which he'd dragged into the corner.<br>
All he did was glance at the body lying face down.<br>
He didn't feel particularly sorry for her.<br>
After all this was a serious competition.<br>
You get what you deserve.<br>
Hirono Shimizu didn't even think twice about shooting him the moment she saw him.<br>
Of course, he'd been the one who snuck up behind Hirono to choke her.<br>
Although he wasn't sure where his next resting spot should be, Toshinori finally decided to move east towards the residential area.<br>
The area on the map was approximately two hundred square meters.<br>
According to the map, the narrow flat land extending outward from the residential area turned into farm fields spotted with houses.<br>
Once he was well beyond this zone then all he had to do was hide in one of these houses.<br>
After all, he came from a privileged family and lived in what was probably the nicest house in the prefecture (Kazuo Kiriyama's house was probably the nicest, but Toshinori would never admit this).<br>
Hiding in bushes was beneath him.<br>
Entering a house was dangerous, given how someone might already be hiding there, but he wasn't worried.<br>
Now he not only had a bulletproof vest (with a certificate of high quality) but the revolver he'd taken from Hirono.<br>
Furthermore…<br>
…he was now wearing a full-face motorcycle helmet he'd found inside the house.<br>
A thin cloud appeared in the sky.<br>
Its tip was already slowly beginning to cross the low full moon.<br>
After checking the chin guard of his superdeluxe helmet, he crossed the yard and made his way down the edge of the narrow field next to it.<br>
He could see the flat land continuing down to the eastern shore.<br>
It wasn't completely flat, though.<br>
It went up and down.<br>
Most of the area was covered with farms visible by their various moonlit shades.<br>
On the left, a hundred meters away, was a house by the base of the northern mountain.<br>
There was another house another hundred meters to its right.<br>
Further left were two more houses.<br>
There were no other houses in the vicinity.<br>
Three to four hundred meters away were farms spotted with houses.<br>
He couldn't see very well because his view was blocked by a hill and the woods, but this geography seemed to continue out to the residential area on the island's east side.<br>
The flames from the intense explosion that came immediately after Sakamochi's midnight announcement were located immediately to the right of the hill.<br>
But the flames must have gone out, because now the area sank back into darkness.<br>
On the south side, to his right, were two adjacent houses.<br>
But this was—if you assumed the blue dots indicated residential houses—on the borderline between sectors E=4 and F=4.<br>
Behind him the northern and southern mountains were connected—or to be more accurate, the base of the northern mountain stretched out like a cliff along the western shore without any houses in sight.<br>
According to the map though, there were supposed to be a couple houses up in the mountain.<br>
Unless he'd misread the map, he'd be outside the forbidden zone if he got to the third or fourth house to the east.<br>
But if he found out they were dumps, then he might have to consider moving further on.<br>
First of all, he couldn't stand dirty houses, and second of all, he was certain a vulgar place would only attract vulgar people.<br>
Toshinori decided to move over there.<br>
He crouched down and walked cautiously along the field ridge of the farm.<br>
But he was appalled at the sensation of dirty soil.<br>
The dull pain he felt from Hirono Shimizu's shot in the stomach area of his bulletproof vest only infuriated him more.<br>
Why did he have to be thrown into this coarse game and writhe around on the ground with the &quot;vulgar masses&quot;? (This was an expression his father, who ran the largest food company in the eastern part of the prefecture, often used at home, but it was a favorite phrase Toshinori himself used to express his scorn for the &quot;vulgar masses.&quot; Of course, he was well bred, so he could never say it out loud.)<br>
Whether he had a right to claim it or not, it was true he possessed a unique gift, unique even among his talented classmates who ranged from being star players of their teams and clubs to being leading delinquents, or even being queer (this one was dead now, he was a very vulgar queer too).<br>
In fact, it was unique to the entire school.<br>
He'd started private violin lessons when he was four years old, and now he was one of the leading junior high school players in the entire prefecture.<br>
He wasn't a genius, but he wasn't mediocre either.<br>
Arrangements were made for him to enter a highly distinguished high school in Tokyo that had its own music department.<br>
As for his future career, he thought he'd at the very least become the prefectural government symphony conductor.<br>
This gave him—so he believed—all the more reason not to die.<br>
He would attain the status of conductor, marry a beautiful, refined woman, and mingle with rich, elegant people.<br>
(His older brother Tadanori was going to inherit the company.<br>
Of course, the thought of making a lot of money as president was attractive, but I don't need to deal with food products, yuck.<br>
I'll let my vulgar brother deal with that.) He was different from his loser classmates.<br>
Their deaths wouldn't mean a thing, but he was gifted.<br>
He was precious.<br>
And even in biological terms, the superior species was destined to survive, right?<br>
At first he only had this bulletproof vest, oddly supplied as a weapon, so all he could do was sneak away and hide, but now he had a gun.<br>
He was going to be merciless.<br>
What's this about the noble soul of a music lover? That's totally naive! It was true he was only fifteen, and he hadn't seen much of the world, but he knew what the music world was like.<br>
For those who weren't geniuses it was all about money and connections.<br>
It was all about crushing other competitors to survive.<br>
Whether this was objectively true or not, this was what Toshinori Oda believed.<br>
Of course, he had no close friends in Third Year Class B that was filled with the vulgar masses.<br>
In fact, he despised his vulgar classmates.<br>
Especially Shuya Nanahara.<br>
Toshinori did not take part in the Shiroiwa Junior High Music Club, which was filled with vulgar masses who were especially vulgar.<br>
All those losers played was popular music (apparently the club office was cluttered with music sheets of illegal foreign music).<br>
That's right.<br>
Especially Shuya Nanahara.<br>
Toshinori was vastly superior to him in term of music ability, given his ear training and understanding of music theory.<br>
And yet, in spite of that, the vulgar bitches in his class would scream out indecently at the sound of Shuya Nanahara plucking out kindergarten-level chords on his guitar (I mean come on those bitches who listen to Shuya Nanahara playing during the short break before music class, they might as well have printed on their foreheads in thick Gothic font: &quot;Oh, Shuya, do me now, right here&quot;).<br>
In contrast, they'd only politely applaud when Toshinori finished playing an elegant passage from an opera at the music teacher's request.<br>
For one thing, those loser bitches could never appreciate classical music, and for another, it was only because Shuya Nanahara was good-looking (although Toshinori would never admit it, deep down inside he couldn't stand his own ugly face).<br>
Fine.<br>
That's what women are like anyway.<br>
They're just a different species.<br>
Just a tool to produce children (and of course to provide pleasure for men when they need it), and if they were good-looking then they were just ornaments to place beside successful men.<br>
Yes, it all came down to…money and connections.<br>
And my talent is worth the investment of money and connections.<br>
Therefore…<br>
…1 deserve to be the survivor.<br>
He heard gunfire at times throughout the night, and there was that amazing explosion to top it all off, but now the island was immersed in darkness and silence.<br>
Toshinori quickly circled the first house, passed it, and approached the second one.<br>
He could tell it was pretty old even though he could only make out its silhouette.<br>
The house was surrounded by a circle of trees, and on the west side in front was an extremely large broadleaf tree, its branches spread out.<br>
Its circumference was four to five meters, and it was seven to eight meters tall.<br>
There shouldn't be anyone…here.<br>
Toshinori gripped his gun and slowly moved forward, cautiously checking the house as well as the tree.<br>
Of course he didn't forget to stop and look in all directions.<br>
You never knew where the vulgar masses might show up.<br>
Just like cockroaches.<br>
After spending a full five minutes passing by the side of the house, he looked over his shoulder and checked the house, which was surrounded by trees of various sizes.<br>
There were no suspicious movements that he could see through his open helmet's square window.<br>
All right.<br>
He could see the third house, the one he wanted, nearby.<br>
Toshinori turned around one more time.<br>
He thought something round and black stirred near the ground between the trees surrounding the house.<br>
It was…<br>
…someone's head, he realized, but by then he was aiming his gun over there.<br>
But this one was wandering in an area that would become a forbidden zone soon.<br>
Who could it possibly be?…<br>
It didn't matter.<br>
He pulled the trigger.<br>
Holding the Smith &amp; Wesson Military &amp; Police's wooden grip, he felt a sudden jerk in the palm of his hand.<br>
The gun popped with an orange flash, sending a sting down Toshinori's spine.<br>
Although he despised the ignorant, vulgar masses, he had a hobby that wasn't so refined, much less refined than playing the violin.<br>
He still had his model gun collection.<br>
His father owned several hunting rifles, but he was never allowed to handle them, so this was the first time he'd ever pulled the trigger of a real gun.<br>
It was real.<br>
Damn, I'm shooting a real gun!<br>
Toshinori shot twice and his opponent crouched down, unable to move, it seemed.<br>
The person didn't shoot back either.<br>
Of course not, if he had a gun he would have shot me from behind.<br>
That's what let me pull the trigger in the first place.<br>
Toshinori slowly approached the figure.<br>
It shouted, &quot;Stop!&quot;<br>
He could tell from his voice it was Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No.<br>
11).<br>
That tall guy (Toshinori by the way hated tall guys too.<br>
His height was only 162 centimeters and next to Yutaka Seto he was the shortest guy in their class.<br>
He couldn't stand: [a] good looking guys, [b] tall guys, and [c] all-around vulgar guys) who practiced that vulgar karate-like sport.<br>
He was supposedly going out with Takako Chigusa who tastelessly dyed her hair and wore all that gaudy jewelry—oh, that's right, she was also dead now.<br>
She wasn't bad looking though.<br>
Hiroki continued, &quot;I'm not fighting this game! Who are you? Yuichiro?&quot;<br>
Hiroki had guessed it was Yuichiro Takiguchi (Male Student No.<br>
13), who was the next shortest guy to Toshinori.<br>
Yes, since Hiroshi Kuronaga had died a while ago, the only ones left alive who were his height were Yuichiro and Yutaka.<br>
In any case, Toshinori wondered for a moment, what's this about not fighting? Impossible.<br>
Not playing this game would be tantamount to committing suicide.<br>
Is he trying to fool me? Even if he was, as long as he doesn't have a gun…<br>
Toshinori changed his course of action.<br>
He lowered his gun.<br>
With his left hand he pulled down on the chin guard of the helmet and said, &quot;It's Toshinori.&quot; Then he thought, oh, I should probably stutter a little.<br>
&quot;S-sorry I did that.<br>
A-are you hurt?&quot;<br>
Hiroki Sugimura slowly got up, revealing his large frame.<br>
Like Toshinori he had his day pack on his right shoulder.<br>
His right hand held a stick.<br>
His right sleeve was missing, maybe it was torn or maybe he'd torn it off.<br>
His shirt was missing underneath and his right arm was bare.<br>
A white cloth was wrapped around the shoulder.<br>
With his bare right arm holding the stick he resembled a naked primitive tribesman.<br>
A vulgar naked tribe.<br>
&quot;I'm all right.&quot; Then he asked, looking at Toshinori's head, &quot;Is that a helmet?&quot;<br>
&quot;U-uh yes.&quot; As he answered, Toshinori came forward, stepping onto the farm soil.<br>
All right, three more steps.<br>
&quot;I-I've been so scaaaared.&quot; Before he finished saying &quot;scared&quot; Toshinori raised his right hand.<br>
Five meters away, he couldn't miss.<br>
Hiroki's eyes opened wide.<br>
Too late, too late, you vulgar karate bastard.<br>
You're going to die a vulgar death, end up in a vulgar grave, and I'll offer you the most vulgar flowers I can find.<br>
But Hiroki wasn't there at the end of the muzzle of the exploding Smith &amp; Wesson.<br>
A split second before the shot, Hiroki had unexpectedly ducked to his left—Toshinori's right.<br>
Toshinori of course had no idea Hiroki had used a martial arts move, but in any case…he was incredibly fast.<br>
From this crouched position, Hiroki held up, instead of the stick in his left hand, a gun in his left hand (Toshinori also had no way of knowing that—although, in contrast to Shinji Mimura, he had &quot;fixed&quot;<br>
it—Hiroki was originally in fact left-handed).<br>
So he already had a gun…then why didn't the fool use it in the first place? Before this thought barely crossed his mind a small flame exploded.<br>
The gun was suddenly gone from his right hand.<br>
The next moment he felt a searing pain and his right ring finger exploded.<br>
Toshinori shrieked.<br>
He fell on both his knees and held the painful stump with his left hand…and realized his ring finger was gone.<br>
Blood spurted out.<br>
He might have been wearing a bulletproof vest and a helmet, but his fingers were unprotected.<br>
Argh…that bastard…my finger…my right finger that elegantly guides the violin bow is!…that can't be…in the movies fingers never get blown away in gun fights!<br>
Hiroki approached him, gun in hand.<br>
Toshinori held his right hand and gazed at it, his eyes inside his helmet terrified and delirious.<br>
His face was getting clammy from the sweat breaking out under his helmet.<br>
Hiroki said, &quot;So you're totally up for this.<br>
I don't want to shoot…but I have no choice.<br>
I have to.&quot;<br>
Toshinori had no idea what Hiroki meant at all, and although he was in terrible pain, he still felt confident.<br>
Because…the gun was pointed at his chest.<br>
Of course, it would be.<br>
He wore the helmet not so much because it was bulletproof but because it would force his enemy to aim at his body instead.<br>
And under his school coat he was wearing the bulletproof vest.<br>
As long as his vest stopped the bullet, then all he would have to do is wait for a chance to retrieve his gun and then—since his index finger was still working— he could pull the trigger and win.<br>
His gun was by his feet.<br>
With Toshinori glaring at him, Hiroki Sugimura still paused a few moments…but Hiroki pursed his lips tightly and calmly squeezed the trigger.<br>
Toshinori recalled his fight against Hirono Shimizu and considered how he should play &quot;dead.&quot;<br>
But it ended much more than abruptly than he'd expected.<br>
Hiroki's gun only made a small metallic click.<br>
Hiroki looked confused.<br>
He nervously cocked the gun and pulled the trigger.<br>
Again, click.<br>
Toshinori's lips twisted into a smile hidden under the helmet.<br>
Karate bastard.<br>
That was a dud.<br>
With that automatic you'll have to pull the breechblock and reload the chamber.<br>
Toshinori went for his gun by his feet.<br>
Hiroki immediately responded with the stick in his right hand but instead—maybe he thought it was too far—he turned around and ran toward the mountain beyond the house.<br>
Toshinori picked up the gun.<br>
His crippled hand ached, but he still managed to hold it.<br>
He fired.<br>
Because his hold on the grip wasn't tight he couldn't fix his aim on Hiroki, but he could tell he hit him in the thigh, right near his butt.<br>
Did it only scrape him? In any case, Hiroki suddenly tottered, but he didn't fall.<br>
He continued tunning.<br>
Toshinori also started running and fired another shot.<br>
This time he missed.<br>
The recoil of the gun so pleasurable only moments ago now sent a sharp pain through his injured hand which infuriated Toshinori.<br>
He shot again.<br>
He missed again.<br>
In spite of being shot in the leg, Hiroki was faster than him.<br>
Hiroki disappeared into the woods at the foot of the mountain.<br>
Damn it!<br>
Toshinori deliberated whether he should chase him—and decided not to.<br>
His opponent was injured but so was he.<br>
The gun grip was slippery from the blood pouring from the stump of his former ring finger.<br>
Besides, if he entered the mountains now, Hiroki would reload his gun and shoot back.<br>
In that situation, it'd be too dangerous to expose himself like that with nothing to hide behind.<br>
He nervously crouched down.<br>
He had to get to the first house—the house he'd decided to enter.<br>
And he had to make sure Hiroki wouldn't see him enter it.<br>
Toshinori clutched his right hand, which was still holding the gun, and staggered over there, enduring the pain.<br>
As he traveled down the footpath the pain became more and more excruciating.<br>
He felt dizzy.<br>
First thing was his hand.<br>
He had to treat it.<br>
He had to come up with a different strategy.<br>
Oh, but, damn, even if he were able to play the violin after rehabilitation this crippled hand would stick out during a performance, especially if they televise it and zoom in.<br>
So now I'm going to be joining that lame group—the disabled.<br>
What a nice melody, how he's overcome his disability.<br>
How lame!<br>
He was approaching the house.<br>
Toshinori looked over his shoulder again.<br>
He looked closely, but didn't see any sign of Hiroki.<br>
He was safe now.<br>
Hiroki wasn't coming after him.<br>
Toshinori looked back at the house.<br>
He saw a guy standing on the farm field six to seven meters away, right in front of the house he wanted.<br>
The guy had appeared suddenly out of nowhere.<br>
He had slicked-back hair that reached a little too far behind his neck and cold, gleaming eyes.<br>
By the time he realized it was Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No.<br>
6) (another guy he couldn't stand, category [a] good looking), a heavy burst of fire came out of his hands along with a rattling sound, slamming against Toshinori's torso.<br>
Toshinori was blown back and fell backward.<br>
Because his grip on the gun had loosened from the pain he'd been feeling in his right hand, he dropped it and heard it knock against something.<br>
His back scraped against the dirt.<br>
His head wearing the helmet hit the ground.<br>
The echoing gunfire faded into the night air.<br>
All was quiet once again.<br>
But of course Toshinori Oda wasn't dead.<br>
He held his breath and lay down, frozen, trying his best to restrain his urge to snicker.<br>
Now that he was overwhelmed by this wicked pleasure, the agonizing pain from his right hand, not to mention his anger at letting Hiroki Sugimura escape, or his anger at being suddenly attacked by a guy in category (a), his emotional faculties were a complete mess, but his body (with the exception of his right ring finger), just as it had been with Hirono Shimizu, was completely intact.<br>
So he was right to wear the helmet.<br>
Kazuo had aimed at Toshinori's torso, which was protected by the bulletproof vest.<br>
Just as Hiroki had done, Kazuo probably assumed Toshinori was dead.<br>
His eyelids nearly shut, his field of vision resembled a widescreen movie.<br>
He could see at the far end of his field of vision the S&amp;W flash faintly against the moonlight.<br>
And now he could feel the stiff shape of the kitchen knife (which he found in the house where he'd killed Hirono Shimizu) he had tucked in back.<br>
It would take less than a second to unwrap the cloth around it.<br>
As he continued to sweat, which was the one thing he couldn't hold back, Toshinori thought, all right, now pick up that gun lying over there.<br>
Then I'll slash that vulgar windpipe of yours.<br>
Or will you turn around and leave? Then I'll pick up the gun and dig a nice tunnel through that vulgar skull of yours.<br>
Come on.<br>
Make your choice.<br>
Just hurry up and choose.<br>
But for some reason, instead of approaching the gun, Kazuo came straight at Toshinori.<br>
He was coming straight at him.<br>
Staring at him with those cold eyes.<br>
Why? Toshinori wondered.<br>
I'm supposed to be dead.<br>
Look how good I am at playing dead.<br>
Kazuo didn't stop.<br>
He kept on approaching.<br>
One step, two…<br>
But I'm supposed to be dead! Why!?<br>
The faint sound of his steps on the soil became louder and his field of vision was now filled with the figure of Kazuo.<br>
!…<br>
Suddenly overcome with panic and fear, Toshinori frantically opened his eyes.<br>
Kazuo's Ingram once again let out a burst of fire into Toshinori's shielded head.<br>
Some of the point-blank shots turned into colorful sparks from scraping against the reinforced plastic shell of the helmet while others, after exiting Toshinori's skull, ricocheted inside his helmet, rattling Toshinori's head along with the helmet (his body was dancing a strange boogie.<br>
Toshinori himself would have been irritated by this kind of vulgar dancing).<br>
And of course by the time it was all over…Toshinori's head was crushed inside his helmet.<br>
Toshinori no longer played dead.<br>
He remained frozen.<br>
Blood dripped out from under the helmet, which resembled a bowl of sauce.<br>
And so this boy who despised the ignorant, vulgar masses, foolish Toshinori Oda, had overestimated the value of his bulletproof vest and underestimated Kazuo Kiriyama's calm actions.<br>
As a result he died easily.<br>
If he'd thought about how Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano had died yesterday morning, he would have realized that his assailant would have followed up on his enemy to deliver a coup de grace, but he wasn't so perceptive.<br>
Furthermore—it was quite irrelevant now—he had no idea his killer, Kazuo Kiriyama, had, in his mansion that was much larger than Toshinori's home in Shiroiwa-cho, mastered the violin at a level far superior to Toshinori's a long time ago (and then tossed his violin into the trash).<br>
16 students remaining<br>
55<br>
Some chatting.<br>
The sound of someone moving.<br>
She'd even settle for the faint sound of someone desperately trying to hold his or her breath.<br>
Instead, Mitsuko Souma (Female Student No.<br>
11) ended up hearing the sound of liquid running through grass.<br>
She could tell it was someone pissing in the grove nearby (unless there was a dog on the island).<br>
Dawn was approaching.<br>
She glanced up and saw a faint blue beginning emerge in the dark sky.<br>
After encountering Hiroki and somehow managing to escape him, Mitsuko first decided she needed a gun.<br>
She'd accidentally come across Megumi Eto and, upon hearing Yoshimi Yahagi and Yoji Kuramoto in the middle of their fight, she'd killed them and managed to get her hands on a gun (if she'd had a gun in the first place she would have gone back to the school and killed off everyone that came out one by one).<br>
Once she had a gun she could confidently move around the island, so it was easy to kill Takako Chigusa, who'd just finished fighting Kazushi Nüda.<br>
(She should have finished her off though.<br>
She'd have to be more careful next time.)<br>
But now she was unarmed.<br>
She had used Megumi Eto's knife, and the only thing in her hand now was her original sickle from the beginning of the game.<br>
She had to get a gun because she wasn't the only one who chose to play this game.<br>
There was the machine gun shooter who killed Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano.<br>
She had just heard it go off again only thirty minutes ago.<br>
Of course, thanks to the shooter, she didn't have to kill off as many of her classmates.<br>
She could just let the assailant take care of that.<br>
She'd only kill when it came easy.<br>
In fact, after midnight, when she heard the machine gun's rapid gunfire along with the explosion afterwards, she decided it was best to avoid that area.<br>
A handgun against a machine gun, she'd be outmatched.<br>
So she decided to move somewhere she could view the area from a distance, and that was how she ended up finding and following Hiroki Sugimura.<br>
And that was supposed to be an easy kill but…<br>
It was highly likely she'd end up having to take on this machine gun shooter.<br>
Not having a gun would be a major disadvantage.<br>
Forget about gun against machine gun, it'd be hopeless with a sickle against a machine gun.<br>
Of course, she could have pursued Hiroki, but she thought it'd be too much trouble to get the gun back from him.<br>
His background in martial arts or whatever it was was no joke.<br>
Her right hand still stung from his blow.<br>
And this time, if he saw her, he'd be merciless and shoot her.<br>
So Mitsuko moved west along the longitudinal road and then entered the northern mountain, trying to find someone else.<br>
Approximately three hours had passed.<br>
And now she finally heard someone making noise.<br>
Mitsuko made her way through the thicket and moved forward, cautiously though.<br>
She mustn't be heard.<br>
The thicket ended.<br>
There was a small, open, mat-sized space in the middle of the bushes.<br>
The grove continued on and beyond her right.<br>
And to the left as well—in the corner of the space, a boy in his school coat had his back toward her.<br>
He nervously looked to his right and left as the dripping sound against the leaves continued.<br>
He was probably scared he might be attacked by someone.<br>
She could tell it was Tadakatsu Hatagami (Male Student No.<br>
18).<br>
He was on the baseball team.<br>
Nothing exceptional, just an average guy.<br>
He was tall and well-built, and his face was average.<br>
His hobbies were…actually she had no idea, and besides there was no point asking now.<br>
The crucial thing was that, as Tadakatsu was attending to his business, Mitsuko realized he held something tightly in his right hand.<br>
It was a gun.<br>
It was a fairly large model, a revolver.<br>
She once again broke into that fallen angel's grin.<br>
Tadakatsu still wasn't done.<br>
He might have been holding it in for quite a while.<br>
He continued to look left and right while he emptied his bladder.<br>
Mitsuko quietly but quickly took out her sickle with her right hand.<br>
Tadakatsu would have to use both of his hands to zip up his pants.<br>
Even if he tried using one hand, he'd be vulnerable.<br>
It looks like this'll be the end of you.<br>
Didn't someone in a detective show get killed this way?<br>
The drips became sporadic.<br>
It stopped…and then another drip, and then it stopped completely.<br>
Tadakatsu once again looked around and then quickly moved his hands to the front.<br>
By then Mitsuko had already snuck up behind him.<br>
The back of his head, with short spiked hair, was right in front of her.<br>
She raised the sickle.<br>
She heard someone from behind say, &quot;Whoa,&quot; and Tadakatsu suddenly turned around, along with Mitsuko.<br>
She (of course) put the sickle down and looked back at the speaker behind her.<br>
It was Yuichiro Takiguchi (Male Student No.<br>
13).<br>
He was shorter than Tadakatsu and had a cute, boyish face.<br>
He held what appeared to be his weapon, an aluminum bat, in his right hand and stared at Mitsuko, his mouth agape.<br>
Tadakatsu saw Mitsuko and also said, &quot;Whoa,&quot; and then muttered, &quot;Damn,&quot; and pointed the gun at her.<br>
Seeing how Yuichiro's appearance didn't surprise him, Mitsuko realized they were together.<br>
Mitsuko cursed herself.<br>
Tadakatsu had left Yuichiro just to take a piss.<br>
How stupid could I have been not to check! Come on, you're both boys, can't you just pee next to each other!?<br>
This wasn't the time or place to lecture them.<br>
Tadakatsu's revolver (which, although it hardly mattered, was a Smith &amp; Wesson M19 .357 Magnum) was pointed directly at Mitsuko's chest.<br>
&quot;Tadakatsu! Stop it!&quot; Yuichiro said, his voice trembling, probably from her sudden appearance and his fear of seeing someone get killed in front of his very own eyes.<br>
Tadakatsu looked like he was ready to pull the trigger at any moment, but his finger on the trigger stopped a fraction of a millimeter before the hammer fell.<br>
His gun still pointed at Mitsuko, Tadakatsu looked over at Yuichiro.<br>
&quot;Why!? She just tried to kill me! Look! A sickle! She's holding a sickle!&quot;<br>
&quot;N-no.&quot; Mitsuko croaked as if her words were stuck in her throat.<br>
She made sure her voice was high-pitched and trembling, and of course, she didn't forget to flinch her body back.<br>
Once again, the star actress had a chance to show off her talents.<br>
Watch me now.<br>
&quot;I-I…&quot;<br>
She thought of dropping the sickle, but decided not to, since it would look more natural holding it.<br>
&quot;I was just trying to call you.<br>
Then I-I realized you were peeing, so I…&quot; Mitsuko looked down and made her face blush.<br>
&quot;So…&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu didn't lower the gun.<br>
&quot;You're lying! You were trying to kill me!&quot; His hand holding the gun was trembling.<br>
He'd restrained himself from shooting her because he'd never shot someone.<br>
The moment he saw her he probably would have fired reflexively, but now that Yuichiro had intervened he had time to think and hesitate.<br>
And that meant…<br>
…he would lose.<br>
&quot;Stop it, Tadakatsu,&quot; Yuichiro pleaded with him, &quot;Didn't I already say how we have to join up with others—&quot;<br>
&quot;You got to be kidding.&quot; Tadakatsu shook his head.<br>
&quot;There's no way I can be with this bitch.<br>
Don't you know who we're dealing with? She might have been the one…who killed Yumiko and Yukiko.&quot;<br>
&quot;N-no…I would never…&quot; Mitsuko made her eyes brim with tears.<br>
Yuichiro said frantically, &quot;Mitsuko isn't carrying a machine gun.<br>
She doesn't even have a gun.&quot;<br>
&quot;We can't know for sure! She might have tossed them once she ran out of bullets!!&quot;<br>
Yuichiro fell silent for a while, but then said, &quot;Tadakatsu, you shouldn't raise your voice.&quot; His voice sounded different from before.<br>
It was calm and kind.<br>
Tadakatsu opened his mouth slightly as if he'd been caught off guard.<br>
Mitsuko was also a bit surprised.<br>
Yuichiro Takiguchi was into anime.<br>
He was the otaku of their class, but now he sounded quite dignified.<br>
Yuichiro shook his head.<br>
&quot;You shouldn't be so indiscriminately suspicious,&quot; he continued as if admonishing Tadakatsu.<br>
&quot;Think about it.<br>
Mitsuko might have sought you out because she really trusted you.&quot;<br>
&quot;But then…&quot; Tadakatsu knit his brows.<br>
His gun was still pointed at Mitsuko, but the tension of his fingers on the trigger seemed to wane.<br>
&quot;Then what do you suggest we do?&quot;<br>
&quot;If you insist she can't be trusted, then we can take turns keeping an eye on her.<br>
I mean, even if we were to tell her to leave, you'd still be worried she might attack you later when she has the chance.&quot;<br>
Well, I'll say, I'm impressed.<br>
He's sharp and articulate.<br>
I mean, putting aside whether he's making a good call (which in fact would be to shoot me now).<br>
Tadakatsu then licked his lips a little.<br>
&quot;Come on.<br>
We need more people on our side.<br>
And then we have to figure out a way to get out of here.<br>
Once we spend some time with her we'll see whether we can trust her, right?&quot; Yuichiro insisted and finally Tadakatsu nodded, still eyeing her suspiciously.<br>
He said in a tired voice, &quot;Well, all right.&quot;<br>
Making herself look relieved, she let her body unwind.<br>
She rubbed her left hand against her eyes deliberately filled with tears.<br>
Yuichiro let out a sigh of relief too.<br>
&quot;Get rid of that sickle,&quot; Tadakatsu said, and Mitsuko immediately tossed it to the ground.<br>
Then she nervously alternated glances at Tadakatsu and Yuichiro.<br>
Tadakatsu said, &quot;Search her, Yuichiro.&quot; Mitsuko looked back at Tadakatsu, her eyes opened wide as if she didn't understand.<br>
Then she looked at Yuichiro who stood still in astonishment.<br>
Tadakatsu repeated himself.<br>
He aimed the gun at her.<br>
&quot;Hurry up.<br>
Don't be so bashful.<br>
This is a matter of life and death.<br>
You know that.&quot;<br>
&quot;Okay…all right.&quot; Yuichiro put his bat down and reluctantly came forward.<br>
He stood right beside Mitsuko.<br>
&quot;Hurry,&quot; Tadakatsu insisted.<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot;<br>
His dignified manner was gone now.<br>
He'd gone back to being his usual weak otaku self.<br>
&quot;But—&quot;<br>
&quot;Hurry!&quot;<br>
Yuichiro said, &quot;U-uh, Mitsuko, I'm really sorry.<br>
I really don't want to do this, but I have to,&quot; and he ran his hands lightly over her body.<br>
Even in the dim light at dawn, she could tell his face had turned bright red.<br>
How cute.<br>
Of course, she didn't forget to act all embarrassed too.<br>
After he was done searching, he lifted his hands.<br>
Tadakatsu said, &quot;Look under her skirt too.&quot;<br>
&quot;Tadakatsu—&quot; Yuichiro protested, but Tadakatsu shook his head.<br>
&quot;I'm not trying to get my rocks off.<br>
I just don't want to die.&quot;<br>
So Yuichiro blushed even more and said, &quot;U-uh, I was wondering, could you lift your skirt up a little?&quot;<br>
Oh my, let's not have a heart attack here, little boy.<br>
But Mitsuko only answered in a meek voice, &quot;O-okay,&quot; and lifted her skirt bashfully again up to where her underwear was nearly visible.<br>
Geez, this was turning into one of those adult videos titled Fetish Special! Starring Real Junior High School Girls!<br>
I've actually been in them.<br>
After making sure Mitsuko had nothing to hide, Yuichiro said, &quot;I-I'm done.&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu nodded and said, &quot;All right.<br>
Yuichiro, I want you to tie up her hands with your belt.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro gave Tadakatsu another reluctant look, but Tadakatsu refused to give in, aiming his gun at her.<br>
&quot;Those are my conditions.<br>
If you can't accept them, then I'll shoot her now.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro looked at Mitsuko, then at Tadakatsu, and licked his lips.<br>
Then Mitsuko said to Yuichiro,<br>
&quot;Yuichiro, go ahead.<br>
It's all right.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro looked at Mitsuko, but then nodded, pulled out his belt, and held Mitsuko's hands.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, Mitsuko,&quot; he said.<br>
Tadakatsu still pointed his gun at her, and said, &quot;You don't have to be so polite with her,&quot; but Yuichiro seemed to ignore his warning as he gently wrapped the belt around her wrists without saying another word.<br>
As she innocently offered her hands, Mitsuko was thinking how lucky, in spite of the situation, she was to have been discovered right before lifting her sickle.<br>
(She had also wiped the blood off the sickle earlier.<br>
Now that's luck.)<br>
Now then, what's my next move?<br>
16 students remaining<br>
56<br>
&quot;So that's how I thought we had to seek other classmates,&quot; Yuichiro said and stopped, glancing at Mitsuko.<br>
Dawn had already broken, and she could see how his face was grimy with dirt.<br>
They were sitting next to each other in the shrubs.<br>
Of course, Mitsuko's hands were tied up with the belt, and her sickle was tucked in the back of Yuichiro's pants.<br>
Tadakatsu Hatagami was in a deep sleep.<br>
He still held onto his gun which he had in fact tied to his hand with a handkerchief.<br>
After she ended up with this duo, Tadakatsu was the one who insisted on taking turns sleeping.<br>
&quot;I agree we have to find others, but let's get some sleep.<br>
We've been up all this time.<br>
We'll lose our ability to make sound judgments.&quot; Once Yuichiro agreed Tadakatsu said, &quot;First, it's going to be Yuichiro or me.<br>
Then Mitsuko can sleep after us,&quot; and Yuichiro responded, &quot;I can sleep later,&quot; so the order was decided.<br>
Holding his gun (which should have been handed over to Yuichiro who was keeping watch, but Tadakatsu didn't even mention it, nor did Yuichiro protest), Tadakatsu lay down and fell asleep within a matter of seconds.<br>
Mitsuko had an idea how they hooked up.<br>
Tadakatsu hadn't slept at all until he met Yuichiro, and he probably couldn't sleep after joining him.<br>
Why? Because he was probably afraid Yuichiro might attack him by surprise.<br>
And even though Mitsuko might be much more threatening than Yuichiro, now that she was with them, even if Tadakatsu slept, Mitsuko and Yuichiro would have to keep an eye on each other so long as he held onto his gun and remained cautious.<br>
He could still get some sleep.<br>
(Of course, Mitsuko hadn't slept at all either, but it was nothing to her.<br>
She was much tougher than your average wimpy junior high school kid.)<br>
Yuichiro and Mitsuko remained silent for a while, but then Yuichiro told her how he'd ended up joining Tadakatsu.<br>
It turned out that Yuichiro also didn't move at all during the day, but then assuming he was safer at night (of course, Mitsuko thought, it could go either way.<br>
You could escape detection at night, but that also meant it was hard to detect your opponent too.<br>
But of course, if you were in a tight spot and had to run away, night was better), he cautiously began to move and encountered Tadakatsu only two hours before Mitsuko encountered them.<br>
The two tried to concoct an escape plan but came up with nothing…and so Tadakatsu stepped out to pee, but because he was taking so long Yuichiro got worried and checked on him.<br>
And that was how he found Mitsuko.<br>
&quot;I was so scared at first, I thought I couldn't trust anybody.<br>
But then I realized most of us probably just want to escape.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro stopped and glanced at Mitsuko.<br>
The otaku of Class B, Yuichiro Takiguchi avoided direct eye contact in his conversations.<br>
He always looked down.<br>
Still, from the way he talked to her, Yuichiro didn't seem to be all that cautious towards her.<br>
For some reason.<br>
And so Mitsuko pretended to look somewhat relieved and asked him, &quot;So Tadakatsu had that gun.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro nodded.<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
&quot;Weren't you scared of Tadakatsu?&quot; Okay, now act even more relaxed and a little more intimate.<br>
&quot;No, I mean even now.<br>
He won't let go of it.&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu grinned.<br>
&quot;Well, first of all, Tadakatsu didn't shoot at me or anything.<br>
He did point his gun at me.<br>
I was classmates with him in elementary school.<br>
So I know him pretty well.&quot;<br>
&quot;But…&quot; Mitsuko made her face look slightly pale.<br>
&quot;You saw how Yumiko…Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano died.<br>
Some of us are playing this game.<br>
How can you be sure Tadakatsu isn't one of them?&quot; She nodded and then said, &quot;…he even suspects me.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro tightened his lips and nodded several times.<br>
&quot;That's true.<br>
But if we just sit still we'll end up dying.<br>
It's best to try.<br>
I can't be like Yumiko and Yukiko, but I was thinking how we could get others to join us gradually.&quot;<br>
He glanced into Mitsuko's eyes for a moment and then looked down.<br>
He seemed even more withdrawn than usual, maybe because he wasn't used to looking at a girl's face so close up.<br>
(She was probably right on the mark, and on top of that, he was dealing with the most beautiful girl in the class.)<br>
&quot;You can't blame Tadakatsu for holding onto that gun.<br>
He's scared out of his wits.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko tilted her head and forced a smile.<br>
&quot;You're so good.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro glanced at her out of the corner of his eye.<br>
Still wearing her smile, Mitsuko continued, &quot;You have to be brave to be like that, to be able to empathize with others like that.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro looked down bashfully again and nervously ran his right hand through his messy hair and said, &quot;I don't think so.&quot; Then without looking at her, he said, &quot;So…could you cut him some slack for suspecting you? I think he's really scared.<br>
He trusts no one.&quot;<br>
Trust no one.<br>
The phrase really tickled her and she grinned.<br>
Then she said as if sighing, &quot;I guess he can't help it.<br>
I have a reputation.<br>
You probably don't trust me either.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro paused and then turned to Mitsuko.<br>
This time he looked at her a little longer.<br>
Then he said,<br>
&quot;No.&quot; He looked down at the ground after saying this, and continued, &quot;Well, I mean, I'm even suspicious of Tadakatsu when it comes down to it.<br>
I mean…&quot; He pulled out some grass by his feet.<br>
Then he tore the grass that was moist with morning dew into small strands.<br>
&quot;I mean, yeah, I haven't heard great things about you.<br>
But that's so irrelevant in this situation.<br>
I mean, sometimes it's the respectable ones who end up breaking up under stress.&quot; He tossed the torn grass by his feet.<br>
Then he looked up at Mitsuko.<br>
&quot;I don't think you're such a bad person.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko tilted her head.<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
Maybe it was because she was staring at her, Yuichiro nervously looked away again.<br>
Then he said,<br>
&quot;Well…it's your eyes.&quot;<br>
&quot;Eyes?&quot;<br>
Still looking down, Yuichiro began tearing out more grass.<br>
&quot;You always had a scary look in your eyes.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko forced a smile.<br>
She tried to shrug her shoulders, but it didn't work because of the belt around her wrists.<br>
&quot;I guess.&quot;<br>
&quot;But…&quot; The grass was torn into quarters, then eighths.<br>
&quot;But sometimes your eyes look really sad and kind.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko stared at the side of his face and listened without responding.<br>
&quot;So,&quot; he tossed the grass again and continued, &quot;I've always thought you weren't as bad as everyone said you were.<br>
Even if you'd done bad things, I was pretty sure you did them because you couldn't help it, because there was some reason behind it that wasn't your fault.&quot;<br>
He was stuttering, his voice incredibly shy and tense as if he were confessing his love to a girl.<br>
Then he added, &quot;I just don't want to be so foolish I couldn't understand that reason.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko sighed inside.<br>
Of course, she was thinking, boy, you are naive, Yuichiro.<br>
But then…<br>
…she smiled and said warmly, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Even she was surprised by the kindness in her voice.<br>
Of course, it was deliberate, but maybe the reason it sounded too real to be an act was that there was a little bit of true feeling in her words.<br>
But…that's all it was.<br>
Yuichiro then asked, &quot;What about you, Mitsuko? What were you doing till now?&quot;<br>
Mitsuko replied, &quot;Well…&quot; She moved a little and felt the morning dew on the grass soaking through her skirt.<br>
&quot;I've been running away.<br>
You know, away from the gunfire.<br>
That's why…that's why when I saw Tadakatsu I was so scared…but I was also so tired and scared of being alone and I thought of calling out to him…I thought maybe he'd understand…but I just couldn't tell whether it was the right thing to do or not…I just didn't know…&quot;<br>
Yuichiro nodded again.<br>
He glanced at her again and looked down.<br>
&quot;I think you did the right thing.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko smiled and said, &quot;I think so too.&quot; Their eyes met and they smiled at each other.<br>
&quot;That's right,&quot; Yuichiro said, &quot;I'm sorry.<br>
I forgot.<br>
You must be thirsty.<br>
You lost your bag, right? You probably haven't had any water in a while.&quot;<br>
She had left her day pack behind when she fought Hiroki Sugimura.<br>
She was actually pretty thirsty.<br>
She nodded.<br>
&quot;Could I…could I have some water?&quot;<br>
Looking away from her, Yuichiro nodded back, reached out for the day pack and picked it up.<br>
He pulled out two water bottles and after comparing them he chose the sealed bottle and tucked away the other one.<br>
He broke the seal off the new bottle.<br>
Mitsuko put up her belt-bound hands.<br>
Yuichiro was about to hand over the bottle to her…but then stopped.<br>
He glanced over at Tadakatsu who still seemed sound sleep, then looked down at the plastic bottle in his hand.<br>
Then he put the bottle down by his leg.<br>
Hey there, aren't you going to let me have a drink? You decided not to spoil the prisoner because that might upset tough Sergeant Hatagami?<br>
Yuichiro took her hands without a word instead, had her raise them, and fingered the belt around her wrists.<br>
He began to unfasten it.<br>
&quot;Yuichiro…&quot; Mitsuko said as if surprised (which in fact she was), &quot;…are you sure this is okay?<br>
Tadakatsu will be really mad.&quot;<br>
Concentrating on her wrists, Yuichiro answered, &quot;It's all right.<br>
I have your weapon.<br>
Besides, how can you drink with your hands bound like that?&quot; Yuichiro glanced up at Mitsuko again.<br>
She smiled warmly and said, &quot;Thank you,&quot; making her cheeks blush as she looked down.<br>
The belt came loose.<br>
Mitsuko rubbed each of her wrists.<br>
Because the belt wasn't tight they were fine.<br>
Yuichiro offered his bottle to Mitsuko.<br>
Mitsuko grabbed it and took two brief, delicate sips.<br>
She returned the bottle.<br>
&quot;That's all?&quot; he asked and stopped wrapping his belt around his waist.<br>
&quot;You can drink more.<br>
If we run out, we can always get more from some house with a well.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko shook her head.<br>
&quot;Oh no, I'm fine.&quot;<br>
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro took the bottle.<br>
After he stuffed it into his day pack, he buckled his belt around his waist.<br>
Mitsuko said to Yuichiro, &quot;Yuichiro.&quot; He looked up.<br>
Mitsuko quickly reached out her free hands and gently held his right hand.<br>
Yuichiro appeared to tense up, not because he suspected her of some ulterior motive, but more simply because a girl was holding his hand.<br>
&quot;Wh-what?&quot;<br>
Mitsuko smiled warmly.<br>
She opened her nicely shaped lips and gently spoke, &quot;I'm so glad I'm with someone like you.<br>
I was so scared I've been shaking all this time…but now I'm safe.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro seemed to break into a grin.<br>
His tense mouth quivered and he finally managed to blurt out,<br>
&quot;You're safe.&quot; It seemed like he wanted to take his right hand back, but Mitsuko refused to let go, clutching onto it.<br>
Yuichiro had a hard time speaking and his voice sounded nervous, but then he managed to utter, &quot;I'll protect you, Mitsuko.&quot;<br>
He added, &quot;We have Tadakatsu too.<br>
He's pretty worked up right now, but once he calms down, he'll see you couldn't possibly be our enemy.<br>
Then the three of us can work on finding the rest of the class.<br>
Then we'll come up with some way of escaping.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko gave a warm smile.<br>
&quot;Thank you.<br>
I'm so relieved.&quot;<br>
She squeezed her grip on Yuichiro's hand.<br>
Yuichiro blushed even more and glanced away again.<br>
He said,<br>
&quot;U-uh, Mitsuko.<br>
Y-you know, you're really p-pretty.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko raised her brow.<br>
&quot;No…really?&quot;<br>
Yuichiro nodded repeatedly.<br>
Rather than nodding, he seemed to be trembling from the unbearable tension.<br>
This made Mitsuko smile and she realized this smile had no ulterior motive.<br>
Well, almost none.<br>
16 students remaining<br>
57<br>
Sakamochi's 6 a.m.<br>
announcement woke up Tadakatsu.<br>
He hadn't even slept two hours, but insisted it was enough and untied the handkerchief from his wrist to get a good grip on the gun.<br>
Then he sat by Mitsuko and Yuichiro.<br>
Yuichiro insisted on her sleeping before him, but Mitsuko abstained, so Yuichiro ended up lying down.<br>
(By this time, they had learned that four students—Keita Iijima, Toshinori Oda, Yutaka Seto, and Shinji Mimura—had recently died.<br>
The new forbidden zones were not in their vicinity.) Tadakatsu was dismayed to find out the belt on Mitsuko's wrists had been unfastened, but Yuichiro managed to convince him it would be okay.<br>
Of course, even if Yuichiro hadn't unfastened the belt, Mitsuko had plans to have it unfastened anyway…using Tadakatsu.<br>
Now then.<br>
She couldn't really afford to take her time.<br>
If Hiroki Sugimura showed up he'd completely blow her cover.<br>
(She wondered, what is he doing wandering around like that anyway? Is he, like Yuichiro and Tadakatsu, trying to find others to hook up with?) And there was…that machine gun shooter.<br>
Although Yuichiro had said to Mitsuko with a smile, &quot;I might not be able to sleep,&quot; he went out like a light in five minutes.<br>
Given how he was an otaku boy, he couldn't have much stamina.<br>
He must be tired.<br>
Unlike Tadakatsu who snored, Yuichiro fell into the hushed deep sleep of a little baby.<br>
Tadakatsu kept a good distance of three meters on her left, sitting against a tree.<br>
He had short, cropped hair and light acne above his cheekbones.<br>
And the eyes above them…were cautiously watching Mitsuko.<br>
The revolver in his right hand was no longer pointed at her, but his finger was definitely on the trigger, as if to indicate he could shoot her at any moment.<br>
Mitsuko waited another half hour…and then after making sure Yuichiro, whose back faced them, was still asleep, she turned to Tadakatsu and quietly said, &quot;You don't have to look at me like that.<br>
I'm harmless.&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu grimaced.<br>
&quot;You never know.&quot;<br>
As if responding to Tadakatsu's retort, Yuichiro's body stirred a little.<br>
For a while Mitsuko and Tadakatsu looked at Yuichiro's back.<br>
His deep breathing resumed, though.<br>
Without looking over at Tadakatsu, Mitsuko took a deep breath to indicate her fatigue.<br>
Then she moved her legs, putting her right knee down on the ground and bringing her left knee up.<br>
Her pleated skirt smoothly slid down, revealing most of her white thighs, but Mitsuko just looked around, pretending not to notice.<br>
She could tell Tadakatsu had tensed up.<br>
Ha.<br>
Maybe you can see my panties? They're hot pink silk.<br>
Mitsuko stayed in this position.<br>
Then she slowly looked over at Tadakatsu.<br>
Tadakatsu nervously looked up.<br>
Of course…until then his eyes had been glued to her thighs.<br>
But Mitsuko still acted as if she were clueless and said, &quot;Hey, Tadakatsu.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu seemed to be doing his best to maintain his intimidating stance, but now there was a slight tremble in his voice.<br>
&quot;I am so scared.&quot;<br>
She thought Tadakatsu would say something nasty again, but he didn't respond and only stared at her.<br>
&quot;Aren't you scared?&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu's brow moved a little, but then he said, &quot;Of course, I am.<br>
That's why I'm being so careful with you.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko looked sadly away from Tadakatsu.<br>
&quot;So you still won't trust me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't hold it against me,&quot; Tadakatsu said, but his tone of voice wasn't even half as hostile as it had been.<br>
&quot;I know I'm repeating myself, but I just don't want to die.&quot;<br>
Mitsuko quickly looked back at Tadakatsu.<br>
She said a little emphatically, &quot;I'm in the same boat too.<br>
I don't want to die.<br>
But if you don't trust me, then we'll never be able to cooperate and find a way to save ourselves.&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh, well…&quot; Tadakatsu nodded as if relenting.<br>
&quot;Well…I know that but…&quot;<br>
Mitsuko smiled warmly.<br>
She looked into her opponent's eyes and her well-formed, red lips smiled___It was different from the one she wore during her somewhat idyllic conversation with Yuichiro.<br>
This one was Mitsuko Souma's special fallen angel's smile.<br>
Tadakatsu's eyes were glazed, seduced.<br>
&quot;Hey, Tadakatsu,&quot; she continued as she returned to her terrified-girl face.<br>
This constant switch between expressions, the virgin and the whore, day and night.<br>
Wow.<br>
Sounds like a movie title.<br>
&quot;Wh-what?&quot;<br>
&quot;I know I keep on saying this, but I'm just so scared.&quot;<br>
&quot;U-uh huh.&quot;<br>
&quot;So…&quot; She looked at him directly again.<br>
&quot;So?&quot;<br>
Any trace of antagonism and suspicion was now gone from Tadakatsu's voice and face.<br>
Mitsuko tilted her head slightly and asked, &quot;Can we talk a little?&quot;<br>
&quot;…talk?&quot; He knit his brows.<br>
&quot;Aren't we doing that right now?…&quot;<br>
Mitsuko hissed, &quot;Don't be stupid.<br>
Do I have to spell it out?&quot; Her eyes glued on Tadakatsu, she pointed her chin at Yuichiro.<br>
&quot;Not here, okay? I want to talk to you, but not with Yuichiro here.&quot;<br>
His mouth slightly open, Tadakatsu gazed over at Yuichiro…and then looked back at Mitsuko.<br>
&quot;Okay?&quot; Mitsuko said.<br>
She got up, looked around, and decided the thicket behind Tadakatsu would be best.<br>
She walked over to Tadakatsu, tilted her head slightly, and then proceeded forward.<br>
She wasn't sure whether he would take the bait…but then after a while she could tell he was nibbling.<br>
Mitsuko stopped approximately twenty meters away from where Yuichiro slept.<br>
Just like the previous area, it was a small opening surrounded by bushes.<br>
When she turned around, Tadakatsu appeared, wading through the thicket.<br>
His eyes were glazed.<br>
But maybe it was subconscious___He still kept a tight grip on his gun.<br>
Mitsuko immediately pulled down the side zipper of her skirt.<br>
Her pleated skirt fell to the ground, exposing her thighs in the dull morning light.<br>
She could tell he was holding his breath.<br>
Then she removed her scarf and undressed.<br>
Unlike the other girls she'd never be so square as to wear an undershirt, so she only had her underwear on now.<br>
Oh right, she had to take off her shoes.<br>
After she took them off, she stared at Tadakatsu with her fallen angel's smile.<br>
&quot;M-Mitsuko…&quot; Tadakatsu barely managed to utter.<br>
Mitsuko decided to make sure.<br>
&quot;I'm so scared, Tadakatsu.<br>
So…&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu awkwardly approached Mitsuko.<br>
Mitsuko looked down at his right hand, pretending to suddenly notice the gun, and said, &quot;Put that thing somewhere else.&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu lifted his hand, as if he suddenly became aware of its existence, and gazed at it.<br>
Then he put it down, away from them.<br>
He approached her again.<br>
Mitsuko gave a nice smile, spread out her arms, and wrapped her hands around his neck.<br>
His body trembled but the moment Mitsuko offered her lips, he immediately began sucking on them.<br>
Mitsuko received him by breathing heavily.<br>
After a while their lips separated.<br>
Mitsuko looked up at Tadakatsu's eyes and said, &quot;This is your first time, huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;So what?&quot; Tadakatsu said, his voice trembling.<br>
They fell down on the grass, Mitsuko underneath.<br>
Tadakatsu immediately went for her breasts.<br>
You idiot, you're supposed to make out for a while before you do that, Mitsuko thought.<br>
Instead she moaned, &quot;Ahh…&quot; Tadakatsu's rough hands slipped off her bra and clutched at her well-endowed breasts, now exposed.<br>
Then his face went down there.<br>
&quot;Ahh…ahh…&quot;<br>
She continued pretending to be turned on (in exaggerated porn-video style), but meanwhile her right hand was reaching down to her panties....<br>
Her fingertips touched a hard, thin object.<br>
Gang girls probably didn't use such cheap, clunky weapons anymore.<br>
But it'd been Mitsuko's weapon of choice for a long time now.<br>
The most useful weapon right now for her was in fact something she could hide in her panties.<br>
Tadakatsu was preoccupied with kissing Mitsuko's breasts.<br>
His left hand reached between her legs.<br>
Mitsuko then let out a moan…but Tadakatsu's eyes were concentrating on her breasts.<br>
His scalp was exposed.<br>
Mitsuko slowly moved her right hand near his neck.<br>
Sorry, Tadakatsu.<br>
But at least you get to go out with a nice memory, so you can forgive me, right? Too bad we won't go all the way, though.<br>
Mitsuko's right ring finger gently touched Tadakatsu's neck.<br>
The object was between her index and middle finger.<br>
Kaw kaw, a bird cried, unfortunately, to her right.<br>
Tadakatsu raised his head reflexively and glanced over in that direction.<br>
It was only the sound of a bird crying.<br>
What really made Tadakatsu's eyes open wide was of course…<br>
…the razor blade in Mitsuko's hand right in front of his face.<br>
Damn it!<br>
How bad can my timing be, the thought sort of crossed her mind, but Mitsuko didn't care as she automatically swung the blade.<br>
He groaned and pulled away from Mitsuko.<br>
The blade skimmed his neck, but the cut was way too shallow to be fatal.<br>
My oh my, good reflexes.<br>
That's right, you're a baseball jock.<br>
Tadakatsu stood up, his eyes open wide, staring down at Mitsuko, her body half raised.<br>
He appeared to be on the verge of saying something but seemed at a loss for words.<br>
She could care less about Tadakatsu's state.<br>
She leaped up and made a dash for the revolver immediately to her right.<br>
But Tadakatsu's body flew in front of her in a head-first slide.<br>
He scooped the gun from the ground, rolled over, and got up on his knees.<br>
Ever since elementary school Tadakatsu played the shortstop position formerly occupied by Shuya Nanahara (even though she and Shuya went to different schools Shuya's reputation as a star player in Little League was so widespread even Mitsuko had heard of him), so the Shiroiwa Junior High School baseball team is in good hands, huh? Well, at least you didn't take off your pants.<br>
You would have looked pretty pathetic naked.<br>
That was besides the point, though.<br>
Once Mitsuko realized Tadakatsu would get the gun before she did, she changed course.<br>
She heard gunshots behind her, but they missed as she ran into the thicket.<br>
She could hear Tadakatsu chasing her.<br>
He would catch up.<br>
That was for sure.<br>
She got out of the thicket.<br>
There was Yuichiro Takiguchi.<br>
He looked like he'd heard the gunfire, got up, and then realizing Mitsuko and Tadakatsu were gone, was looking around, but the moment his eyes found her, they opened wide.<br>
(Of course.<br>
She was half naked.<br>
What a bonus! Mitsuko Souma's One Night Show.<br>
Oh wait, but it's morning.)<br>
&quot;Yuichiro!&quot; Mitsuko raised her voice and ran towards Yuichiro.<br>
She didn't forget to crumple up her face.<br>
&quot;Wh-what happened, Mitsuko?&quot;<br>
By the time Tadakatsu Hatagami made his way through the bushes, Mitsuko was behind Yuichiro's back.<br>
Because Yuichiro was only four or five centimeters taller than her, she couldn't really hide behind him, but oh well.<br>
&quot;Yuichiro!&quot; Tadakatsu stopped and held his gun, groaning.<br>
&quot;Get out of my way!&quot;<br>
&quot;H-hold on.&quot; His face still drowsy, Yuichiro spoke quickly perhaps because he didn't fully grasp the situation.<br>
Mitsuko grabbed his shoulders from behind and pressed her half naked body against his back.<br>
Yuichiro said, &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Mitsuko tried to kill me! I told you, man!&quot;<br>
Still hiding behind Yuichiro, Mitsuko said in a feeble voice, &quot;Th-that's not true.<br>
Tadakatsu tried to force me to…he threatened me with that gun.<br>
Please, help me, Yuichiro!&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu's face contorted in dismay.<br>
&quot;I-it's not true, Yuichiro! Th-that's right.<br>
Look!&quot; Tadakatsu pointed at his neck with the fingers of his empty left hand.<br>
The narrow cut had a slight blood stain.<br>
&quot;She went at me with a razor blade!&quot;<br>
Yuichiro turned around and looked at Mitsuko out of the corner of his eye.<br>
Mitsuko shook her head (as cutely as possible, as if terrified, now she was playing the virgin).<br>
&quot;I was so desperate…I had to use my nails on him.<br>
Then…Tadakatsu got mad…and tried to shoot me…&quot;<br>
She had already gotten rid of the razor blade in the shrubs.<br>
Even if she were forced to take off all her clothes (she was nearly naked anyway now) for a body search, they'd find no evidence.<br>
Now Tadakatsu's face flushed red with anger.<br>
&quot;Move, Yuichiro!&quot; he shouted.<br>
&quot;I'm shooting her!&quot;<br>
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Yuichiro said, trying his best to sound calm, &quot;I…that's right…I can't tell who's telling the truth.&quot;<br>
&quot;What!?&quot; Tadakatsu raised his voice, but Yuichiro wasn't intimidated.<br>
He reached out his right hand to Tadakatsu.<br>
&quot;Give me your gun.<br>
Then we'll see who's telling the truth.&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu's face contorted as if he were on the verge of crying out of misery.<br>
And wearing this face he screamed at Yuichiro, &quot;We can't afford to take our time here! You're going to get killed too if we don't get rid of her now!&quot;<br>
Mitsuko cried out, &quot;That's awful.<br>
I would never do that.<br>
Help me, Yuichiro.&quot; She squeezed his shoulders tightly.<br>
Yuichiro patiently extended his hand.<br>
&quot;Give it to me, Tadakatsu if you're telling the truth.&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu grimaced again.<br>
But eventually, after taking a long, deep breath, letting his shoulders down, he exhaled and lowered his gun.<br>
He put his finger on the trigger guard, flipped the gun grip forward, and offered it to Yuichiro as if he had no choice.<br>
Of course she still wore her weepy face… but there was a faint glimmer in her eyes.<br>
The key moment would be when the gun was in Yuichiro's hands.<br>
It should be easy to take away from him.<br>
The question was how.<br>
Yuichiro nodded and came forward.<br>
But then…<br>
It was a move that was almost identical to the one Hiroki Sugimura had made with the Colt Government against her.<br>
Like a magic trick, the gun flipped over in his hand.<br>
Simultaneously, Tadakatsu got down on his right knee and leaned sideways.<br>
The gun was pointed directly at Mitsuko, its line of fire passing right by Yuichiro's left shoulder.<br>
Now that she wasn't clinging to Yuichiro's back Mitsuko was completely exposed.<br>
Yuichiro followed the gun's target and quickly looked back at Mitsuko.<br>
Mitsuko's eyes opened wide.<br>
I'm dead now—<br>
Without hesitating, Tadakatsu pulled the trigger.<br>
Gunfire.<br>
Two shots.<br>
Yuichiro's body fell down slowly as if in slow motion right in front of her.<br>
Beyond it was the frightened face of Tadakatsu.<br>
By then Mitsuko had picked up the sickle Yuichiro had beside him when he went to sleep.<br>
She threw it.<br>
It spun through the air.<br>
Its banana-shaped blade lodged into Tadakatsu's right shoulder.<br>
He groaned and dropped his gun.<br>
Mitsuko didn't waste a single moment.<br>
She picked up the bat and dashed forward.<br>
She leapt over Yuichiro, who was lying face down, ran towards Tadakatsu, and with this forward momentum took a full swing at his head as he staggered, clutching his right shoulder.<br>
Hey there.<br>
Here's something familiar, a bat.<br>
Hope you like it.<br>
Thud.<br>
The end of the bat landed in the center of his face.<br>
She'd crushed in his nose cartilage and cheekbones, tearing out several of his teeth.<br>
Tadakatsu fainted.<br>
Mitsuko swung at his forehead.<br>
KRAK! His forehead caved in.<br>
His eyes bulged out and his hands balled up into fists.<br>
One more swing, this time she aimed at the bridge of his nose.<br>
Mitsuko Souma's Special Training for One Thousand Catches.<br>
Come on, come on, this next one's going into center field.<br>
Blood burst out of Tadakatsu's nostrils with this blow.<br>
Mitsuko put the bat down.<br>
Tadakatsu's entire face was immersed in blood.<br>
He was dead by now.<br>
Thick streams of blood came dripping out of his ears and his deformed nose.<br>
Mitsuko tossed the bat and picked up the pistol lying to her left.<br>
Then she walked over to Yuichiro who was lying down on his face.<br>
The blood stain spread all over the grass underneath.<br>
He had shielded Mitsuko.<br>
That one instant.<br>
Mitsuko slowly knelt down by Yuichiro.<br>
She could tell he was still breathing as she bent over.<br>
After some consideration, Mitsuko moved over to block Yuichiro's view of Tadakatsu's corpse.<br>
Then she grabbed his shoulder to turn him over.<br>
Yuichiro moaned, &quot;Urgh,&quot; and opened his eyes in a daze.<br>
His school coat had two holes, one in the left chest and the other in his side.<br>
Blood came pouring out, absorbed by the black fabric.<br>
Mitsuko held Yuichiro up.<br>
His eyes wandered around for a while.<br>
Then he looked at Mitsuko.<br>
His short breaths came intermittently, matching his heartbeat.<br>
&quot;M-Mitsuko…&quot; he said, &quot;wh-what about Tadakatsu?&quot;<br>
Mitsuko shook her head.<br>
&quot;He panicked after he shot you and just ran away.&quot;<br>
Tadakatsu had tried to kill Mitsuko so this explanation didn't make much sense.<br>
But…maybe he couldn't think much anymore.<br>
Yuichiro seemed to nod slightly.<br>
&quot;R-really…&quot; His eyes seemed out of focus.<br>
He might only have a partial image of Mitsuko now.<br>
&quot;Y-you didn't get hurt, I hope?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm fine.&quot; She nodded.<br>
And then said, &quot;You saved me.&quot;<br>
Yuichiro seemed to form a slight grin.<br>
&quot;I-I'm so sorry.<br>
I-I don't think I can protect you anymore.<br>
I-I can't m-m-move…&quot;<br>
Foams of blood came bursting out the sides of his mouth.<br>
His lungs must have been punctured.<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; She leaned over and gently hugged his body.<br>
Mitsuko's long black hair fell onto his chest, its ends stained by the blood pouring out of his wounds.<br>
Before she pressed her lips against his, Yuichiro's eyes moved slightly but then they shut.<br>
This kiss was different from the whore's kiss she gave to Tadakatsu moments ago.<br>
It was soft, warm, and kind even though it might have been mixed with the taste of blood.<br>
Their lips parted.<br>
Yuichiro opened his eyes again in a semi-daze.<br>
&quot;I-I'm sorry…&quot; he said, &quot;it looks like…&quot;<br>
Mitsuko smiled.<br>
&quot;I know.&quot;<br>
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! With these dull gunshots Yuichiro's eyes opened wide.<br>
Staring up at Mitsuko's face, and probably having no idea what had just happened, Yuichiro Takiguchi was now dead.<br>
Mitsuko slowly removed the smoking revolver from Yuichiro's stomach and held Yuichiro's body again.<br>
She looked into his now vacant eyes.<br>
&quot;You were pretty cool.<br>
You even made me a little happy.<br>
I won't forget you.&quot;<br>
She closed her eyes.<br>
Almost remorsefully, she once again gently pressed her lips against Yuichiro's.<br>
His lips were still warm.<br>
The sunlight was finally shining on the western slope of the northern mountain.<br>
Under Mitsuko's head, blocking this light, Yuichiro's pupils dilated rapidly.<br>
14 students remaining<br>
58<br>
Shuya Nanahara (Male Student No.<br>
15) suddenly woke up.<br>
He saw the blue sky framed by brilliant green grass.<br>
He got up.<br>
Beyond the grass surrounding him, there was the familiar sight of Shiroiwa Junior High School in the pleasant sunlight.<br>
Several students were on the school field in their gym gear.<br>
Maybe they were playing Softball for gym class.<br>
He could hear their cheering.<br>
He was in the garden at the edge of the courtyard.<br>
He saw the large leaves of the phoenix tree looming above him.<br>
This was where he took a nap sometimes, either during lunch or when he cut class.<br>
He stood up and checked his body.<br>
He had no wounds at all.<br>
Flakes of grass were stuck to his coat.<br>
He brushed them off.<br>
A dream…<br>
Shuya shook his head, still in a daze.<br>
Then he knew for certain.<br>
It was all a dream.<br>
All of it.<br>
He wiped his neck with his hand.<br>
It was moist with sweat.<br>
He was drenched in sweat as if he'd had a nightmare.<br>
What…what a horrible dream! Killing game? We were selected for that &quot;Program&quot;!<br>
Then he realized.<br>
The ones in the field…gym class?<br>
He checked his watch.<br>
Afternoon classes had started.<br>
He'd overslept!<br>
He quickly left the garden and trotted over to the school building.<br>
Today…today was…he checked his watch while running and saw it was Thursday.<br>
The first Thursday afternoon period was literature.<br>
He felt relieved.<br>
He liked literature, and he did pretty well in that class.<br>
Plus his teacher, Kazuko Okazaki, liked him.<br>
So all he'd have to do is bow apologetically.<br>
Literature.<br>
Favorite subject.<br>
Grades.<br>
Ms.<br>
Okazaki.<br>
These words passing through his mind triggered a nostalgic feeling.<br>
Shuya really did like literature.<br>
Even if the stories and essays in the textbooks were inundated with slogans in praise of the Republic or some silly &quot;ideology,&quot; Shuya managed to discover words he liked.<br>
Words were just as important to him as music.<br>
Because rock couldn't do without lyrics.<br>
Speaking of words… the top student in literature, Noriko Nakagawa, wrote beautiful poetry.<br>
Compared to the song lyrics he struggled to come up with, her words were so much more concise and brilliant…they could be open and gentle on the one hand and harsh and strong on the other…he thought they represented the nature of girls in general.<br>
Sure, Yoshitoki Kuninobu had a crush on Noriko, but what really struck Shuya was this part of her.<br>
Which made Shuya realize, oh, that means Yoshitoki is alive.<br>
Realizing how silly the whole ordeal was, he was about to cry from relief as he trotted over.<br>
How silly.<br>
I can't believe I could dream of Yoshitoki dying.<br>
And how did I end up with Noriko?…Hey wait, since when did I stop calling her &quot;Noriko-san&quot;? How presumptuous…in that stupid dream, he thought.<br>
They were linked together in the dream…so does that mean I have some feelings for her beyond admiring her poetry? Uh oh, that means I'll end up fighting with Yoshitoki.<br>
That's trouble.<br>
Still, this idle thought made him grin.<br>
Shuya entered the school building, now hushed because classes were in session.<br>
He ran up the stairs.<br>
Third Year Class B was on the third floor.<br>
He skipped every other step.<br>
He reached the third floor and turned right into the hall.<br>
The second classroom was Class B.<br>
Shuya stopped by the door for a moment, trying to come up with an excuse for Ms.<br>
Okazaki.<br>
He was feeling sick…no, he had a dizzy spell.<br>
So he had to lie down and rest.<br>
Would she believe him, given how he was always in perfect health? Yoshitoki would give an exaggerated shrug, and someone like Yutaka Seto would say something like, &quot;I bet you were sleeping,&quot; Shinji Mimura would snicker, and Hiroki Sugimura, his arms folded, would look mildly amused.<br>
Noriko would smile at Shuya as he scratched his head.<br>
All right, that's what I'll go with.<br>
So what if it's embarrassing.<br>
Shuya put his hand on the door, made himself look as apologetic as possible, and gently slid it open.<br>
Right before he looked up from the formal posture he assumed, a stench assaulted him.<br>
He looked up.<br>
He slid the door open with all his might.<br>
The first thing he saw was someone lying by the lectern.<br>
Ms.<br>
Okazaki…<br>
It wasn't Ms.<br>
Okazaki.<br>
It was their head instructor, Masao Hayashida.<br>
And…<br>
His head was missing.<br>
There was a puddle where it was supposed to be.<br>
Only half of his eyeglass frames were lying beside him.<br>
Shuya tore his eyes off of Mr.<br>
Hayashida's corpse and examined the rest of the class.<br>
There were desks and chairs lined up as usual.<br>
The strange thing was that his familiar classmates were all sprawled over their desks.<br>
And…<br>
The floor was covered with blood.<br>
An intense stench wafted up.<br>
After standing still for a moment, he quickly reached out for Mayumi Tendo—and realized that an antenna-like silver arrow was planted in her back.<br>
Its tip was poking out of her stomach while blood dripped down and off her skirt onto the floor.<br>
Shuya moved forward.<br>
He shook Kazushi Nüda's body.<br>
Kazushi's body tilted with a jerk, revealing its face.<br>
Shuya felt a chill run up his spine.<br>
Kazushi's eyes were now two dark-red holes.<br>
Blood and a slimy egg-white-like substance oozed out of them.<br>
Then… there was a gimlet-like object with a thick handle stabbed into his mouth.<br>
Shuya screamed and ran to Yoshitoki Kuninobu's seat.<br>
There were three holes in his back, each one blooming with flowers of blood.<br>
As he held him up, Yoshitoki's head slumped over onto his shoulder.<br>
His bulging eyes gazed up at the ceiling.<br>
Yoshitoki!…<br>
Shuya raised his voice.<br>
Then he looked around frantically.<br>
Everyone was either slouched back in their chairs or lying on the floor.<br>
Megumi Eto's throat was slashed like sliced watermelon.<br>
A sickle was planted in Yoji Kuramoto's head.<br>
Sakura Ogawa's head was split open like an overripe fruit.<br>
Only half of Yoshimi Yahagi's head existed.<br>
An axe was planted in Tatsumichi Oki's head, his face cracked down the middle, left and right out of alignment like a split peanut.<br>
Kyoichi Motobuchi's stomach looked like a sausage-factory trash bin.<br>
Tadakatsu Hatagami's face was completely crushed and covered in blood.<br>
Hirono Shimizu's face was swollen black, and her sea-slug-sized tongue dangled out from the side of her wide open mouth.<br>
The body of The Third Man, Shinji Mimura, was covered with bullets.<br>
Basically, everyone…was dead.<br>
Something caught Shuya's eye.<br>
Shogo Kawada—that standoffish transfer student with the bad reputation—had deep stab wounds all over his chest.<br>
His eyes were half-open and looking down at the floor…they were out of focus.<br>
Shuya took a deep breath and looked over at Noriko Nakagawa's seat.<br>
It was right behind Yoshitoki's, so he could have noticed earlier.<br>
For some reason though, it felt as if his classmates' seats were swirling around with the corpses.<br>
He finally managed to locate Noriko.<br>
She was still sprawled on top of her desk.<br>
Shuya ran to her and held her up.<br>
THUD.<br>
Her head fell off.<br>
Leaving behind her body, it landed with a thud on the floor and rolled around in a pool of blood…and then looked up at Shuya.<br>
With eyes full of resentment.<br>
I thought you said you would save me, Shuya.<br>
But I ended up dying.<br>
I really loved you, too.<br>
I really did.<br>
His eyes glued to Noriko's face, Shuya held his head and opened his mouth.<br>
He felt he was going crazy.<br>
He could tell a scream was welling up inside.<br>
Suddenly, he saw something white.<br>
As he became physically aware that his body was in fact horizontal, his vision came into focus, and Shuya finally realized it was the ceiling.<br>
On the left side he saw a fluorescent light.<br>
Someone gently touched his chest.<br>
He realized how heavy he was breathing.<br>
His eyes followed the hand up to the arm, the arm up to the shoulder, and finally discerned a sailor-suit figure with braided hair— female class representative Yukie Utsumi (Female Student No.<br>
2), smiling warmly.<br>
&quot;Looks like you're up.<br>
What a relief,&quot; she said.<br>
14 students remaining<br>
59<br>
Shuya tried getting up, but the pain all over his body immediately assaulted him, and he fell back.<br>
He realized then he was lying on a soft bed with fresh sheets.<br>
Yukie gently touched Shuya's chest again, then lifted the puffy blanket up to his neck.<br>
&quot;Don't exert yourself.<br>
You're injured pretty badly…You seemed to be having a bad nightmare.<br>
Do you feel okay?&quot;<br>
Shuya wasn't able to respond coherently.<br>
Instead he surveyed the room.<br>
It was small.<br>
There was cheap fabric wallpaper on the left wall, and on the right behind Yukie was another bed, but besides that there wasn't much else.<br>
There was a door near the foot of the bed, but it was closed.<br>
The wooden frame gave it an old look.<br>
There seemed to be a window above his head letting in a dull light which illuminated the room.<br>
Given how dull the light was it seemed cloudy outside.<br>
But…where was he?<br>
&quot;I don't get it,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
He realized he could speak now.<br>
&quot;I don't remember checking into a hotel with the student representative.&quot;<br>
He was still in a half daze, but Yukie gave a sigh of relief.<br>
Then her full lips erupted into a soft chuckle.<br>
&quot;You would say that, wouldn't you? I'm so relieved you're all right though.&quot; Looking at Shuya, she added,<br>
&quot;You were out for quite some time.<br>
Let see…it's been,&quot; she looked down at her watch on her left wrist,<br>
&quot;about thirteen hours.&quot;<br>
Thirteen hours? Thirteen hours.<br>
Thirteen hours ago I was—<br>
Shuya's eyes opened wide.<br>
His memory and the present locked in.<br>
He was fully awake now.<br>
There was something he needed to find out.<br>
Right away.<br>
&quot;What about Noriko, Noriko Nakagawa? And Shogo Kawada?&quot;<br>
Shuya said this and took a deep breath.<br>
Were they still alive?<br>
Yukie gave him a funny look and then said, &quot;I think Noriko…and Shogo are still alive.<br>
We just heard the afternoon announcement but their names weren't announced.&quot;<br>
Shuya let out a deep breath.<br>
Noriko and Shogo had managed to escape.<br>
Kazuo had chased after him and ended up losing Noriko and Shogo.<br>
Kazuo was—<br>
Shuya then looked up at Yukie.<br>
&quot;Kazuo.<br>
It's Kazuo!&quot; His voice was half panicking.<br>
&quot;Where are we? Are you alone here? We have to be careful!&quot;<br>
Yukie gently touched Shuya's right hand, which was sticking out from under his blanket.<br>
&quot;Calm down.&quot;<br>
Then she asked, &quot;Did Kazuo do this to you?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;He's the one who's been attacking us.<br>
He's totally up for this.&quot;<br>
&quot;Really…&quot; Yukie nodded and continued, &quot;We're safe here.<br>
They're six of us here, not including you.<br>
Everyone else is keeping watch, so don't worry.<br>
They're all close friends of mine.&quot;<br>
Shuya raised his brow.<br>
Six?<br>
&quot;Who?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yuka Nakagawa,&quot; Yukie mentioned the cheery girl who had the same last name as Noriko.<br>
Then she continued, &quot;Satomi Noda and Chisato Matsui.<br>
Haruka Tanizawa.<br>
And Yuko Sakaki.&quot;<br>
Shuya licked his lips.<br>
Yukie saw the expression on his face and asked, &quot;What? You can't trust them?<br>
Which one? Everyone?&quot;<br>
&quot;No…&quot; Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;If they're your friends I trust them.&quot;<br>
But how did six girls, all good friends with each other, manage to get together?<br>
Yukie smiled and squeezed his hand.<br>
&quot;Good.<br>
I'm glad to hear that from you, Shuya.&quot;<br>
Shuya smiled too.<br>
But his smile receded almost instantly.<br>
There were other things he had to know.<br>
He'd already missed three—the midnight, 6 a.m., and noon announcements.<br>
&quot;Who…died?&quot; he asked.<br>
&quot;I-I mean, at midnight, 6 a.m., and noon, there were three announcements, right? Did anyone else…die?&quot;<br>
Yukie's mouth stiffened.<br>
She took some paper from the small side table right beside them.<br>
It was a map and student list.<br>
The folds and mud stains looked familiar.<br>
He realized it was the one he'd kept in his school coat pocket.<br>
Yukie looked over the list and said, &quot;Hirono Shimizu.<br>
And then Keita Iijima, Toshinori Oda, Yutaka Seto, Yuichiro Takiguchi, Tadakatsu Hatagami, and Shinji Mimura.&quot;<br>
Shuya's mouth hung open.<br>
Of course the game had proceeded, but he was shocked it now left only little more than a dozen students.<br>
Plus he'd been teammates with Tadakatsu Hatagami in Little League, but what really took him by surprise was…<br>
&quot;Shinji's…&quot;<br>
The Third Man, Shinji Mimura, had died.<br>
It was hard to believe.<br>
He thought if anyone could survive it would have been Shinji.<br>
Yukie nodded silently.<br>
At the same time Shuya was struck by how he wasn't all that shaken up.<br>
He'd gotten used to it.<br>
That must have been it.<br>
Still, he remembered Shinji's special grin.<br>
Then he recalled that serious expression Shinji wore as he sent him a signal, warning him to calm down when they were back in the school building.<br>
So we're never going to see the awesome play of The Third Man, Shiroiwa Junior High's star shooting guard, again, he thought, and felt a pang of sorrow.<br>
&quot;When was Shinji's name announced?&quot;<br>
&quot;In the morning,&quot; Yukie answered.<br>
&quot;Keita Iijima and Yutaka Seto were also in the morning.<br>
They might have been together.<br>
They were such good friends.&quot;<br>
&quot;I see…&quot;<br>
Shinji had still been alive at midnight.<br>
And as Yukie said, he might have been with Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima.<br>
Yukie added, &quot;There was an incredible explosion last night.<br>
And a lot of gunfire.<br>
That's where it might have come from.&quot;<br>
&quot;Explosion?&quot;<br>
Shuya recalled the hand grenade Kazuo threw at them.<br>
&quot;That was…Kazuo actually used a hand grenade.<br>
Maybe that's what you heard.&quot;<br>
Yukie raised her brow.<br>
&quot;So…that's what that was.<br>
That was a little past eleven, right? No, the one I'm talking about actually happened after we brought you here.<br>
It was past midnight.<br>
It was much worse than the one we heard around eleven.<br>
The one who kept watch said the entire center of the island just lit up.&quot;<br>
Shuya pursed his lips, but then he realized he still hadn't managed to find out exactly where they were.<br>
Before he could ask though, Yukie handed him the map and student list.<br>
&quot;This is yours.<br>
I marked off the map too.&quot;<br>
As he took it, Shuya realized, yes, there were more forbidden zones.<br>
He spread the map out.<br>
&quot;The place where we talked about rock.&quot;<br>
That place, sector C=3, near the western shore, was crossed out with a pencil along with several other sectors.<br>
The small writing, &quot;23rd, 11 a.m.&quot; meant that it was forbidden as of this morning at eleven, while Shuya had been asleep.<br>
Shuya pursed his lips.<br>
Noriko and Shogo weren't there anymore—his thoughts were finally getting clearer—if they haven't died between noon and now.<br>
Of course they were alive…but then he recalled how he'd seen Shogo and Noriko dead along with Yoshitoki and Shinji in his dream.<br>
He felt a chill run down his spine.<br>
But in any case they should be alive.<br>
All he could do was believe they were all right.<br>
But how in the world would he find them?<br>
Shuya put the map down on his chest.<br>
He couldn't afford to waste any time deliberating, under these circumstances.<br>
The first thing was information.<br>
And since he wasn't alone there might be a way.<br>
He looked up at Yukie.<br>
&quot;Where are we anyway? How did I end up in this bed?&quot;<br>
Yukie looked up at the window and said, &quot;This is a lighthouse.&quot;<br>
&quot;Lighthouse?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right.<br>
On the northeast end of the island.<br>
It's marked on the map.<br>
We've been staying here ever since the game started.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked at his map again.<br>
Just as Yukie said, the lighthouse was located in sector C=10, jutting out from the northeast side of the island.<br>
The area was practically devoid of forbidden zones.<br>
&quot;So Shuya, about last night.<br>
The front of this lighthouse is a cliff, and that's where you fell.<br>
The person keeping watch found you…and took you in.<br>
You were injured pretty badly.<br>
Covered with blood.<br>
I thought you were going to die.&quot;<br>
Shuya finally realized his torso was naked and that his throbbing left shoulder was bandaged.<br>
(Given how it felt, he deduced the bullet shattered his shoulder blade and was now lodged in there.) The right side of his neck—he felt a burning sensation right below his collar where there was another bandage (but this bullet wound must have been a minor scrape).<br>
And then on top of his left elbow.<br>
(It felt heavy.<br>
The bullet had most likely exited, but perhaps because the bone or tendon was torn off, it felt paralyzed.) Also his left side.<br>
(The bullet had pierced it, but it seemed to have missed his vital organs.) Shuya awkwardly moved his unscathed right arm and lifted his blanket, confirming he was indeed covered with bandages.<br>
He returned the blanket and asked, &quot;So you treated me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yukie nodded.<br>
&quot;We found an emergency first-aid kit in the lighthouse.<br>
We stitched your wounds a little.<br>
Not a great job, since we didn't know what we were doing and we could only use the string and needle from a sewing set.<br>
It looks like the bullet in your shoulder…is lodged in there.<br>
We couldn't do much.<br>
I thought what you really needed was a blood transfusion.<br>
You were bleeding so badly.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thanks a lot.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Yukie smiled kindly.<br>
&quot;I can't believe I got to touch a guy's body! I even got to take off your clothes.&quot;<br>
Shuya chuckled.<br>
While she was both very smart and considerate, she could also say bold stuff like that.<br>
That's right, she'd been like that ever since he got to know her on a rainy day in the elementary school gym, negotiating the space allocated for Little League practice and girls' volleyball.<br>
And that's right, at the time he'd said to Yoshitoki, &quot;Then there's Utsumi, who's on the volleyball team.<br>
She's pretty cool.<br>
That's my type.<br>
You know, real outgoing.&quot;<br>
Of course right now he wasn't supposed to be indulging in idle emotions.<br>
But when Yukie said, &quot;Oh, yeah, here,&quot; and offered him a cup of water, Shuya couldn't resist whistling.<br>
He was in fact really thirsty.<br>
The cup was already there, on the side table beyond his field of vision.<br>
He thought, how impressive, Representative.<br>
You'll be a wonderful wife some day, no, a wonderful woman.<br>
No, you might in fact be a wonderful woman now.<br>
I've actually thought that for a while.<br>
He took the cup, raised his head, and drank.<br>
His neck wound hurt as he swallowed and grimaced.<br>
But he drank it all.<br>
&quot;I might be asking for too much,&quot; he said, returning the cup, &quot;but I think I should drink a lot more.<br>
And also…do you have any kind of painkiller? Anything.<br>
It'll help me.&quot;<br>
Yukie nodded.<br>
&quot;Sure.<br>
I'll go get some.&quot;<br>
Shuya wiped his lips and then said, &quot;It's amazing your friends accepted me.<br>
I mean, I could be an enemy.&quot;<br>
Yukie shook her head.<br>
&quot;We couldn't just let someone die.<br>
Besides…&quot; She stared into Shuya's eyes and smiled playfully.<br>
&quot;It was you, Shuya.<br>
I'm leading this group, so I forced everyone to agree.&quot;<br>
Did that mean that…she also thought there was something special about them ever since that time at the elementary school gym?<br>
Shuya probed further.<br>
&quot;Which means…that some of them were reluctant.<br>
I knew it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, come on.<br>
Given the circumstances.&quot; Yukie looked down.<br>
&quot;Don't take it the wrong way.<br>
Everyone's very agitated.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;I know.&quot;<br>
&quot;But I convinced them.&quot; She looked up and smiled again.<br>
&quot;So you should be thankful.&quot;<br>
Shuya was nodding when he noticed Yukie, who'd just been smiling, was now for some reason suddenly on the verge of tears.<br>
She stared at him and said, &quot;I was worried sick.<br>
I thought you might die, Shuya.&quot;<br>
Shuya was taken by surprise and looked at her.<br>
Yukie continued, &quot;I just wouldn't know what to do if you died.&quot;<br>
Her voice was now sobbing.<br>
&quot;…do you understand what I'm saying? Do you see why I had to save you, no matter what?&quot;<br>
Shuya stared at Yukie's tearful eyes and slowly nodded.<br>
Then he thought, geez, I can't believe how popular I am.<br>
Of course…this might have been a psychological result of their confinement.<br>
Under these circumstances, they were probably going to die soon (no, according to the rules, they were definitely going to die.<br>
He'd never heard of someone else besides the winner surviving the hellish Program), and now that the survivors were becoming fewer and fewer, maybe a boy that you liked &quot;a little&quot; ever since having an exchange in the corner of an elementary school gym might turn into somebody you'd &quot;die for.&quot;<br>
No, that probably wasn't the case.<br>
She couldn't have opposed her friends unless she really cared for him.<br>
Besides, how else could she have trusted him?<br>
&quot;I understand.<br>
Thanks,&quot; he said.<br>
Yukie wiped her tears with the lower palm of her right hand.<br>
Then she said, &quot;Tell me.<br>
You asked about Noriko and Shogo.<br>
You said, 'we.' Does that mean you were with them?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
Yukie knit her brows.<br>
&quot;I get Noriko…but don't tell me you were really with Shogo.&quot;<br>
Shuya knew what she was getting at.<br>
&quot;Shogo's not a bad guy,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;He saved me.<br>
Noriko and me survived thanks to him.<br>
I'm sure Shogo's protecting Noriko right now…That's right.<br>
There's something more urgent,&quot; he continued enthusiastically.<br>
&quot;I forgot.<br>
We can be saved, Yukie.&quot;<br>
&quot;Saved?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded emphatically.<br>
&quot;Shogo's going to save us.<br>
He knows a way out of here.&quot;<br>
Yukie opened her eyes wide.<br>
&quot;Really? Really? What is it?&quot;<br>
Shuya stopped suddenly.<br>
Shogo had told him, I can't tell you till the end.<br>
Come to think of it…Shuya had nothing to support it.<br>
He trusted Shogo, but he wasn't so sure his explanation would persuade Yukie, who hadn't been with Shogo.<br>
As Shogo himself constantly reminded him, she might suspect Shogo was using Shuya and the others.<br>
Shuya decided though to explain everything from the beginning.<br>
He told her how he'd been attacked by Yoshio Akamatsu from the very beginning, how he'd been with Noriko ever since then, how he'd fought Tatsumichi Oki, and how, while Kyoichi Motobuchi was shooting at him, Shogo had saved him and how the three were together ever since.<br>
He told her about the escape plan, how Shogo was a survivot of the Program last year, how Noriko had a fever, and how they went over to the clinic.<br>
That's right, and then about Hiroki Sugimura.<br>
How Hiroki told them that Mitsuko Souma was dangerous.<br>
And then how they were attacked by Kazuo Kiriyama while they were on the move.<br>
&quot;So Tatsumichi…&quot; After he was done she brought up Tatsumichi Old first for some reason, &quot;…that was an accident?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right.<br>
Just as I described it,&quot; he replied and knit his brows, looking at her.<br>
&quot;What about it?&quot;<br>
Yukie shook her head.<br>
She said, &quot;It's nothing,&quot; and changed the subject, &quot;I'm sorry for being so blunt, but I can't just all of a sudden trust Shogo.<br>
I mean, that there's a way out of here.&quot;<br>
Shuya still didn't understand why Yukie had asked him about Tatsumichi, but he figured it couldn't be all that important so he let it pass and accepted Yukie's skepticism.<br>
&quot;I don't blame you.<br>
But I think we can trust Shogo.<br>
It's hard to explain, but he's good,&quot; he impatiently waved his uninjured right hand by his face.<br>
&quot;You'd understand if you were with him.&quot;<br>
Yukie pressed her right fingers against her lips and said, &quot;All right.<br>
It sounds like we should at least hear him out.<br>
I mean it's not like we have any other option.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked at her.<br>
&quot;What were you planning on doing?&quot;<br>
Yukie shrugged.<br>
&quot;I thought it was hopeless.<br>
We were just discussing whether we were better off trying to escape or staying here a little longer.<br>
But we haven't made any decisions.&quot;<br>
Shuya then realized he'd forgotten to ask something else he'd forgotten.<br>
&quot;How did you guys get together?<br>
All six of you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; Yukie nodded.<br>
&quot;I went back to the school, and I called on everyone.&quot;<br>
Shuya was surprised.<br>
&quot;When?&quot;<br>
&quot;That would have to be right after you and Noriko ran away.<br>
Actually, I saw Kazushi Nüda run…I really wanted to get back in time to contact you, but anyway, that's how I saw…those two dead right in front of the school entrance.&quot;<br>
Shuya raised his brow.<br>
&quot;Yoshio was only unconscious, right?&quot;<br>
Yukie shook her head.<br>
&quot;I wasn't able to get a close look…but he looked dead at that point.<br>
There was an arrow…stuck in his neck.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then Kazushi—&quot;<br>
Yukie nodded.<br>
&quot;I think so.&quot;<br>
Shuya then asked, &quot;Weren't you scared there'd be others like Yoshio?&quot;<br>
&quot;Of course the thought occurred to me…but I just couldn't come up with any other option other than forming a group.<br>
So I went to the woods in front.<br>
I figured if I hid there I wouldn't be seen.<br>
And if I was, then that was just too bad.&quot;<br>
Shuya was deeply moved.<br>
He had to look after Noriko, who was injured, but still, he'd passed on the others and ran away.<br>
Hiroki Sugimura said he'd waited for Takako Chigusa, but he was a guy, and he also practiced martial arts.<br>
&quot;Wow.<br>
I'm amazed, Representative.&quot;<br>
Yukie smiled.<br>
&quot;You call Noriko by her name, but with me it's 'Representative,' huh?&quot;<br>
Shuya didn't know what to say.<br>
&quot;Oh well—&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't worry, it's all right.&quot;<br>
A smile flashed across her face.<br>
Then she continued a little sadly, &quot;Then Yuka Nakagawa came out…and I called her.&quot;<br>
&quot;Were you able to convince her right away? Don't get me wrong—I think you have a good reputation.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, well.&quot; Yukie nodded.<br>
&quot;I didn't come back alone.<br>
I was really shaken up at first, but I just had to come back, and on the way back, I totally lucked out, I found Haruka.<br>
You know how Haruka and I are best friends.<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
Haruka Tanizawa and Yukie were both on the volleyball team.<br>
&quot;I talked to Haruka.<br>
When I told her we should go back she resisted at first, but we had weapons.<br>
I had a pistol in my pack.<br>
When Yuka heard the two of us call she managed to trust us.&quot;<br>
After some consideration, Shuya mentioned that &quot;rule&quot;: &quot;But…you can't necessarily trust someone who's paired up in this game.&quot;<br>
Yukie nodded.<br>
&quot;Yes, that turned out to be true.&quot;<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, we decided not to have boys…sorry…we discussed it and decided boys could mean trouble.<br>
So we let them go, and then there was Fumiyo—&quot; Yukie stopped.<br>
Fumiyo Fujiyoshi (Female Student No.<br>
18) had died before their departure.<br>
&quot;After her came Chisato.<br>
So there were five of us.<br>
We also called on Kaori Minami but…&quot;<br>
Shuya filled in the rest, &quot;She ran away.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, she did.&quot;<br>
Shuya realized he hadn't told her that he'd seen her die.<br>
He thought of telling her—but decided not to.<br>
Now that Kaori's killer Hirono Shimizu was also dead, it didn't seem relevant and besides, it wasn't a pleasant memory.<br>
Also, as awful as it sounded, he couldn't afford to waste any more time talking about the dead.<br>
&quot;So Yoshimi reacted the same way as Kaori?&quot; Shuya uttered the name of the last female student seat number, Yoshimi Yahagi, along with Kaori's and suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.<br>
Names of the dead.<br>
Both of them.<br>
Both… of…them.<br>
Jesus.<br>
The smiling face of the man in the black suit made a sudden appearance in Shuya's mind.<br>
It'd been a while.<br>
Hey there, Shuya.<br>
So you're still alive? You're a tough one.<br>
&quot;Well…&quot; Yukie looked away from Shuya and pursed her lips.<br>
She squinted.<br>
&quot;That was different.&quot;<br>
&quot;How so?&quot;<br>
Yukie took a deep breath.<br>
&quot;I said we should call on her.<br>
But some of the girls protested.<br>
You know Yoshimi was friends with Mitsuko.<br>
They couldn't trust her.&quot;<br>
Shuya fell silent.<br>
Yukie said looking away.<br>
&quot;So she's dead.<br>
We let her die.&quot;<br>
Shuya said, &quot;No, you're wrong.&quot;<br>
Yukie looked back at Shuya.<br>
&quot;It was beyond your control.<br>
It's no one's fault.&quot;<br>
He knew it didn't sound very convincing, but that's all he could say .<br>
Yukie grinned wryly and sighed.<br>
&quot;You're kind.<br>
You've always been so nice.&quot;<br>
They nearly fell silent, but then Shuya had to say something, &quot;You should have called on Shinji.&quot; Yukie's group could have at least called on Shinji Mimura, who was at the tail end of the student list.<br>
&quot;He could have been trusted.&quot;<br>
Yukie sighed again.<br>
&quot;I thought so too…but Shinji didn't have a very good reputation…among the girls.<br>
You know, he was kind of a playboy.<br>
And his intelligence was kind of intimidating.<br>
You know how he intervened when Noriko was injured? One of the girls said that might have been calculated.&quot;<br>
It was the same explanation Shogo gave when he mentioned he'd seen Shinji.<br>
&quot;Before we could decide, Shinji was gone.&quot; Yukie shrugged.<br>
&quot;In any case, we'd decided against boys.<br>
So we didn't call on Kazuhiko either.&quot;<br>
That's right.<br>
Kazuhiko Yamamoto, who went out with Sakura Ogawa, who despite his good looks was kind and unpretentious, and therefore must have been popular with the girls.<br>
Yukie's group decided against contacting him too, though.<br>
And given this policy, it was only to be expected there'd be some friction over taking in Shuya here.<br>
Shuya realized Yukie only accounted for five of them.<br>
She hadn't mentioned Yuko Sakaki (Female Student No.<br>
9).<br>
&quot;What about Yuko? You haven't mentioned her.&quot;<br>
Yukie nodded and looked back at Shuya.<br>
&quot;That was luck too.<br>
We came here yesterday morning…Nice fortress huh? Last night, I think it was around 8 p.m., Yuko just stumbled by here.<br>
She was totally terrified.&quot;<br>
Yukie stopped as if she had something else to say.<br>
Shuya was about to ask her what was wrong, but Yukie continued, &quot;…in any case, everyone knows Yuko.<br>
So it wasn't a problem.&quot;<br>
That summed up her account.<br>
Shuya thought of asking more about Yuko Sakaki but decided not to.<br>
If she'd been alone until last night then she might have encountered something horrible.<br>
Did she survive someone's attack, or did she see students killings each other, or did she come across a corpse torn up from fighting?…<br>
Shuya nodded slightly several times.<br>
&quot;I get it now.&quot;<br>
&quot;There's one thing I don't get,&quot; Yukie said.<br>
&quot;It's not a big deal but…Hiroki was saying he needed to see Kayoko Kotohiki, right? And that was why he didn't join your group.&quot;<br>
Shuya was worried about him ever since he summarized his situation to Yukie.<br>
Hiroki was still alive and so was Kayoko Kotohiki.<br>
Did he manage to find her?<br>
&quot;He had to see her.<br>
I wonder why.&quot;<br>
Shuya shook his head.<br>
&quot;We didn't ask.<br>
He was in a hurry.<br>
We were wondering too—&quot;<br>
As he spoke Shuya couldn't help but wonder, did Hiroki manage to find Kayoko Kotohiki? If he did then—<br>
Shogo's voice suddenly returned: &quot;This sound is your ticket out of here.<br>
If you're up for it, you can come aboard our train.&quot;<br>
Shuya opened his eyes wide and exclaimed, &quot;The bird call.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
Shuya looked over at Yukie.<br>
&quot;I know a way we can join Noriko and Shogo.&quot;<br>
&quot;Really?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
Then he struggled to move his body.<br>
He could explain later.<br>
&quot;I have to contact him now.<br>
I have to get going.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Yukie stopped him.<br>
&quot;You need to rest.&quot;<br>
&quot;I can't.<br>
The more I lie around—&quot;<br>
&quot;I said hold on.<br>
You might want to listen to the girl who's in love with you.&quot; She managed to say this as she blushed a little with a playful smile.<br>
&quot;We took you in here because even if you woke up you wouldn't be able to move.<br>
Your sudden burst of energy might terrify some of the girls.&quot;<br>
Shuya's eyes opened wide.<br>
But then again it made sense.<br>
That was probably why the other girls let Yukie stay with him alone here.<br>
Yukie continued, &quot;In any case, just stay put for a while.<br>
I'll tell them everything you told me.<br>
I'll insist you and Shogo can be trusted and convince them.<br>
As for contacting him and Noriko, I can't let you do that alone.<br>
That's just too dangerous.<br>
I'll discuss that with them too.<br>
So you just stay here.&quot; Then she asked him, &quot;Can you eat?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
In fact he was famished.<br>
He was worried about Noriko and Shogo, but he thought he should eat first.<br>
It would help his immune system fight against his gunshot wounds.<br>
&quot;If you have any food to spare I'd really appreciate it.<br>
I do feel pretty weak.&quot;<br>
Yukie smiled.<br>
&quot;We're preparing lunch right now.<br>
I'll bring you some.<br>
I think it's something like stew.<br>
Is that all right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Stew?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, this place is loaded with food even though it's all just preserved canned food and retort food.<br>
But we found water and solid fuel, so we were able to cook it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Awesome.<br>
That's great.&quot;<br>
Yukie's hand left the edge of the bed.<br>
She walked over to the door and said, &quot;I'm really sorry but I'm going to have to lock the door.&quot;<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.<br>
There's someone who's terrified.<br>
So please, just wait,&quot; Yukie said.<br>
She smiled kindly as she opened the door and went out.<br>
Her two braids of hair swung like some mysterious animal's tail, and he caught a glimpse of a gun stuck in the back of her skirt.<br>
There was a clacking sound from beyond the door.<br>
It might have been bolted shut.<br>
Was that how they locked him up?<br>
Shuya managed to raise his upper body with his right elbow and looked up at the window above his head.<br>
The window was sealed with wooden planks and light leaked in through the gaps.<br>
This was done to keep intruders out—but right now it also served as an ideal place to lock him up.<br>
The fingers of his near paralyzed left arm reflexively formed guitar chords under the blanket.<br>
The chords from that hit tune sung by the rock star the middle-aged man, the one who gave him his guitar, worshipped, &quot;Jailhouse Rock.&quot;<br>
Shuya took a deep breath and lay down on his bed.<br>
The slight movement was enough to send sharp pain through the wound in his side.<br>
14 students remaining<br>

The Okishima Island lighthouse was old but durable.<br>
It faced north with a tower seventeen meters high, and the living quarters, a single-story brick building, had been built as an annex to the tower on its south side.<br>
The dining-kitchen-living room was immediately south of the tower, and further south was the storage room and bathroom.<br>
Further down were two bedrooms, one large, the other small, along with another storage room right near the front entrance.<br>
The hall running on the west side of the building connected these rooms.<br>
(Shuya was resting in the small bedroom by the entrance.) In the corner of the kitchen-living room, which was at least as large as a classroom, was a small table that looked out of place.<br>
Yuko Sakaki (Female Student No.<br>
9) was sitting on one of the stools around the table, slumped over the white tabletop as if she were dozing off.<br>
Unlike the other five girls, she had wandered around the island for hours on end, so a single night here had hardly alleviated her fatigue.<br>
No wonder.<br>
She had a reason for not sleeping at all last night.<br>
Yukie Utsumi's team used this room as their living quarters and slept here too.<br>
Someone had to keep watch at the top of the tower, but otherwise Yukie decided that everyone should stick together.<br>
Right behind Yuko, Haruka Tanizawa (Female Student No.<br>
12) and Chisato Matsui (Female Student No.<br>
19) were busily preparing the preserved food in front of the stove, where solid fuel was lit up in place of the shut-off gas.<br>
At 172 centimeters tall, Haruka was an attacker on the volleyball team.<br>
She and Yukie, who was a setter, formed a great duo.<br>
She had short hair, so next to the long-haired, petit Chisato they almost looked like a couple.<br>
The meal was a retort stew mixed with canned vegetables.<br>
Above them were planks of wood they found in the storage room and hastily hammered into the frosted glass window, which let in the dull light of the cloudy sky.<br>
The planks were there to keep intruders out.<br>
As soon as they had arrived Yukie and the girls immediately sealed off every entrance and exit from the inside of the building.<br>
(The front entrance was designated as their primary entrance-exit, which was where they took Yuko in, but now it was barricaded with desks and lockers.) Yuko had a clear view of the other side of the room where there was a writing desk with a fax machine and computer.<br>
To the left of it, Satomi Noda (Female Student No.<br>
17) was sitting on a sofa placed against the wall, while the table that had been in front of it was now used to barricade the front entrance.<br>
Along with Yukie, Satomi was a model student, and although she always seemed a little frigid, now she looked pretty exhausted as she raised her wire-rimmed glasses and drowsily rubbed her eyes.<br>
To the left of the sofa, the kitchen's side door connected to the hall that led to the front entrance.<br>
On Yuko's right, the far door on the other side led to the bottom of the tower, and the first several steel stairs leading up to the lantern room were visible.<br>
Yuka Nakagawa (Female Student No.<br>
16) was up there, supposedly keeping watch.<br>
Yuko hadn't kept watch yet, but Yukie had told her that since the lighthouse faced the ocean, and since there was only one narrow path from the harbor behind the building, the rest of the area surrounded by mountains, it wasn't very difficult to keep watch.<br>
Yukie was now in the room right by the entrance where they'd kept Shuya Nanahara.<br>
Shuya Nanahara.<br>
Yuko felt the tremor of fear returning.<br>
Along with it the image that was burnt into her memory.<br>
The cracked head.<br>
The bloody axe removed from it.<br>
And the boy who held this axe.<br>
It was a chilling memory.<br>
And this boy—Shuya Nanahara—was now in the lighthouse, the same building she was in.<br>
That was—<br>
No, it's all right.<br>
It's all right.<br>
Trying to keep herself from trembling, she stared at the white tabletop and reminded herself, that's right, he's dying, he can't possibly wake up after so many injuries and so much bleeding.<br>
Someone tapped her on the shoulder and she looked up.<br>
As Haruka Tanizawa sat down next to her, she stared at Yuko and asked, &quot;Did you get any sleep?&quot; She was taking a break from cooking.<br>
Chisato Matsui seemed to be checking the cooking instructions, examining the package of preserved food.<br>
(Chisato had in fact been quietly weeping this morning.<br>
Haruka Tanizawa had whispered to her it was because of the 6 a.m.<br>
announcement of Shinji Mimura's death.<br>
Until then Yuko hardly knew Chisato had a crush on Shinji Mimura.<br>
Her eyes were still red.) Yuko forced a smile and answered, &quot;Yeah, a little.&quot; It was all right.<br>
As long as she was with these other five friends she was all right.<br>
She was safe here.<br>
Even if that safety would expire when their time ran out.<br>
Still—<br>
Haruka brought up the matter.<br>
&quot;What you said about yesterday.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh…&quot; Yuko smiled.<br>
&quot;It's all right now.&quot;<br>
That's right.<br>
It was fine now.<br>
She didn't even want to think about it.<br>
Just the memory sent chills down her spine.<br>
But…in any case…<br>
Shuya Nanahara wasn't going to wake up again.<br>
Then it was all right.<br>
Just fine.<br>
Haruka smiled ambivalently.<br>
&quot;Well then, okay.&quot;<br>
That's right…When Shuya Nanahara was discovered unconscious in front of the lighthouse yesterday, Yuko had vehemently opposed taking him in.<br>
She had explained (she was shouting rather than explaining) what she'd seen, Tatsumichi Oki's split-open skull, how Shuya Nanahara had removed the axe, how dangerous he was, and how he would try to kill them if they let him live.<br>
Yuko and Yukie were on the verge of fighting, but then Haruka and the others insisted they couldn't just let someone die, so they brought Shuya in.<br>
Yuko looked on, face ashen, keeping her distance, while the others carried the blood-drenched Shuya.<br>
It was as if they were welcoming a strange, scary monster that haunted you in your childhood dreams into your house.<br>
No, that's exactly what it was like.<br>
But…as time passed Yuko convinced herself Shuya was dying.<br>
After all, he couldn't possibly survive those wounds.<br>
Knowing he would die of course was unappealing, but in any case she managed to hold herself back.<br>
The one condition she insisted on, though, was that his room be locked.<br>
Haruka continued.<br>
It was the same question they had asked several times yesterday.<br>
&quot;You say you saw Shuya kill Tatsumichi, but it might have been in self-defense, right?&quot;<br>
That was true.<br>
She'd been hiding in the bushes when she heard the thudding sound.<br>
By the time she looked, the only part she really witnessed was Shuya removing the axe from Tatsumichi Oki's head.<br>
Then she immediately ran away.<br>
In other words, as Haruka said (which was based on Yuko's own description), Yuko had only seen the aftermath.<br>
It was possible he had done it in self-defense.<br>
However…<br>
…no matter how many times Haruka and Yukie said this to her, Yuko just couldn't see it that way.<br>
No, she simply rejected the idea.<br>
What do you mean, &quot;possible&quot;? I saw that cracked skull.<br>
I saw Shuya Nanahara holding that axe.<br>
The bloody axe.<br>
The dripping blood.<br>
Her thoughts revolved around this scene now.<br>
Yuko couldn't be rational about Shuya Nanahara anymore.<br>
It was like a natural disaster, like a flood or tornado.<br>
The moment Yuko began thinking about Shuya, that scene and her fear would just wash it all away.<br>
The only thing left was an axiom that was nearly visceral— that Shuya Nanahara was dangerous.<br>
Yuko had her reasons.<br>
She abhorred violence.<br>
She couldn't stand it.<br>
Hearing a friend talk about a splatter film in Class B (was it Yuka Nakagawa? &quot;Of course, it was funny, but, it wasn't a big deal, it should have more gory, ha ha ha&quot;) she felt sick enough to be taken to the school nurse.<br>
It was probably related to her memory of her father.<br>
Even though he wasn't a stepfather—he was her real father—he drank heavily and abused her mother, her older brother, and Yuko herself.<br>
She was too young back then…so Yuko didn't understand why.<br>
She was never able to ask her mother why he was like that.<br>
She didn't even want to remember it.<br>
Well, maybe there were no reasons at all.<br>
She didn't know.<br>
In any case, when her father was stabbed to death by a yakuza over some gambling dispute—Yuko was still in first grade—she felt more relieved than bereaved.<br>
Ever since then she, her mother, and brother led a peaceful life.<br>
They could invite friends over.<br>
They finally felt safe with the disappearance of their father.<br>
But she still sometimes had dreams about him.<br>
Her bleeding mother being beaten with a golf club (even though they were poor, this was the one expensive item in their home).<br>
Her brother being beaten with an ashtray, nearly losing his sight.<br>
And…herself, suffering cigarette burns, paralyzed with fear (her mother who tried to intervene would then be beaten again).<br>
Maybe all of that was related, maybe not.<br>
In any case, Yuko was absolutely convinced Shuya Nanahara was dangerous.<br>
&quot;Right?&quot; She heard Haruka say that emphatically, but her words didn't register.<br>
A chill ran through her body, accompanied by a vision.<br>
Everyone including herself, the six of them lying on the floor, their skulls cracked open, and Shuya Nanahara grinning with an axe in his hand…<br>
No, no.<br>
It's going to be over.<br>
Shuya Nanahara won't be around for long.<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; She looked up and nodded.<br>
In fact, she had no idea what Haruka was talking about.<br>
But in any case as long as Shuya couldn't recover there was no reason to throw the team off balance.<br>
Haruka seemed to be seeking some indication she was convinced.<br>
&quot;Y-yes.<br>
It was just me.<br>
I was so tired too.&quot;<br>
This seemed to put Haruka at ease.<br>
She said, &quot;Shuya's a good guy.<br>
They're aren't too many around like him.&quot;<br>
Yuko looked at Haruka as if she were a mummy exhibited in a museum.<br>
She had thought so too, until recently.<br>
Shuya seemed strange, but all in all there was something very likable about him.<br>
In fact, she'd even thought he was kind of cool.<br>
But any memory of this feeling had completely fallen by the wayside now.<br>
Maybe it was more accurate to say the cracked-skull scene had smothered out all her other memories.<br>
What? What are you saying, Haruka? That he's good? What are you talking about?<br>
Haruka looked into Yuko's eyes dubiously, but added, &quot;So even if he gets up, don't provoke him, okay?&quot;<br>
Yuko was horrified.<br>
There was no way he was going to wake up.<br>
If…if that ever happened…<br>
But a portion of her rational faculties were still intact enough for her to nod and say, &quot;I'm fine.<br>
No problem.&quot;<br>
&quot;Good.<br>
I feel much better.&quot;<br>
Haruka nodded back, turned towards Chisato without getting up, and said, &quot;Smells good.&quot;<br>
Along with the steam, the smell of the stew came drifting from the stove pot.<br>
Chisato turned her head around and said in her quiet, thin voice, &quot;Yes, it looks pretty good.<br>
It might be better than yesterday's soup.&quot;<br>
She had been crying over Shinji Mimura for a long time, but she seemed all right for the time being.<br>
Even Yuko could see that.<br>
Right then, the door to the hall opened up.<br>
It was Yukie Utsumi.<br>
As usual she maintained her perfect posture and walked forward confidently.<br>
After Yuko's arrival, Yukie still did a good job leading the group, but she seemed a little tired.<br>
Ever since they took in Shuya she looked even more distressed.<br>
(It was in fact because she was on the one hand happy to see Shuya, but on the other worried his wounds might prove to be fatal, but this was beyond the scope of Yuko's perception.) Yuko felt like it'd been a while since she last saw Yukie so energetic, but now her face was beaming.<br>
Yuko felt as if a caterpillar was crawling up her spine.<br>
She had a bad feeling about this.<br>
Yukie stopped, put her hands on her waists, and looked around at everyone.<br>
Then she comically cupped her hands against her mouth in the shape of a megaphone.<br>
Then she said, &quot;Shuya Nanahara has arisen.&quot;<br>
Haruka and Chisato cried out with joy while Satomi got up from her sofa, but next to her…<br>
…Yuko turned pale.<br>
14 students remaining<br>
61<br>
&quot;Really? Can he speak?&quot; Haruka asked.<br>
&quot;Uh huh.<br>
He says he's hungry too.&quot; Yukie nodded and then looked over at Yuko and said, &quot;It's all right.<br>
I locked the door to his room so you wouldn't have to worry.&quot;<br>
She wasn't being sarcastic.<br>
It sounded more like she was doing what she should do as the leader.<br>
But that wasn't the point, Yuko thought.<br>
No, actually she had considered it over and over last night.<br>
While she was certain he would never recover, what if he did? Then how would she deal with it?<br>
And…then the odor drifted by.<br>
What timing.<br>
They were about to eat.<br>
Besides…it wouldn't be that odd for a guy in critical condition to die suddenly, would it?<br>
Yuko forced a smile (indeed, it was impeccable) and shook her head.<br>
&quot;I'm not worried,&quot; she continued,<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.<br>
I was all screwed up yesterday.<br>
I won't hold anything against Shuya anymore.&quot;<br>
This seemed to relieve Yukie.<br>
She took a deep breath.<br>
&quot;Well then, I guess I didn't need to lock the door.&quot; She smiled at Yuko and added, &quot;What happened with Tatsumichi Oki was an accident.<br>
That's what Shuya said.&quot;<br>
Hearing Tatsumichi's name, Yuko had a flashback of that scene which sent another chill down her spine, but she managed to keep her smile and nodded.<br>
An accident.<br>
Well, I suppose it was quite an accident for Tatsumichi Oki.<br>
Yukie then said to Haruka, &quot;Hey, Haruka, can you go get Yuka? There's something I need to discuss.&quot;<br>
Haruka asked back, &quot;Shouldn't she be keeping watch?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's all right,&quot; Yukie nodded.<br>
&quot;The building is sealed, so we're fine.<br>
It'll be brief.&quot;<br>
Haruka nodded and entered the room leading up to the lantern room.<br>
You could hear footsteps clang up the steel stairs.<br>
While Satomi and Chisato asked in succession, &quot;How is he?&quot; and &quot;Can he eat the same stuff we're eating?&quot; Yuko quietly stood up from her chair and walked over to the sink.<br>
There was a stack of several deep dishes right beside the steaming stew pot.<br>
Chisato and Haruka had taken them out of the dish cabinet.<br>
Yuko dug her hand into her skirt pocket and touched the object inside.<br>
The weapon she found in her day pack was a telescoping spring baton, but what she now held was this item labeled &quot;special bonus,&quot; the item she had thought was useless.<br>
Even after she was welcomed here she didn't think there was much point in mentioning it.<br>
But when Shuya Nanahara showed up she came up with this idea, so she kept it a secret.<br>
In the past…her father's violence, his terrorization of the rest of her family, ended unexpectedly.<br>
That was how her family finally attained peace.<br>
Now there was another threat.<br>
She had to put a stop to it.<br>
Once she did…she would be safe again.<br>
She wouldn't have to be terrified anymore.<br>
She felt no hesitation.<br>
Oddly enough, she was calm.<br>
She removed the cork lid of the tiny bottle inside her pocket with one hand.<br>
14 students remaining<br>
62<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; Yuko called over to Yukie.<br>
Yukie, who was speaking to Satomi and Chisato, looked over at her.<br>
Yuko continued, &quot;Maybe we should bring Shuya his meal first?&quot;<br>
Yukie beamed a smile at her.<br>
&quot;That's a good idea.<br>
Let's do that.&quot;<br>
Yuko then added very casually, &quot;The stew looks ready, so how about I start serving it up?&quot;<br>
She held the dish.<br>
The dish.<br>
&quot;Sure—oh that's right,&quot; Yukie said as if she suddenly remembered.<br>
&quot;You know, there's a medicine kit in the desk drawer over there.<br>
I think it has some painkillers.<br>
I should bring Shuya some painkillers with his meal.&quot;<br>
&quot;…sure.&quot; Yuko then let go of the dish.<br>
It clicked against the sink.<br>
&quot;Okay.<br>
Hold on.&quot;<br>
The writing desk, equipped with a computer and phone, was across from the sink, in the corner of the room.<br>
Yuko made her way around the table to get there.<br>
Clanging footsteps descended the steel stairs.<br>
Haruka and Yuka Nakagawa entered the room.<br>
Yuka Nakagawa had a short-barreled gun resembling an expanded automatic gun with an extended stock slung over her shoulder.<br>
(It was an Uzi 9mm submachine gun.<br>
It was Satomi Noda's supplied weapon, but because it seemed like the most powerful weapon they had, whoever keeping watch held onto it.)<br>
&quot;I heard Shuya's up!&quot; Yuka said in her usual cheerful voice, placing the Uzi on the table.<br>
A little chubby and, thanks to her tennis team practice in the outdoor courts, tan, Yuka somehow managed to stay cheerful even in these dire circumstances.<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; Yukie nodded happily.<br>
&quot;Well, you must be relieved, Representative,&quot; Yuka teased her.<br>
Yukie blushed a little.<br>
&quot;What are you saying?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, come on.<br>
You're beaming.&quot;<br>
Yukie frowned and then shook her head.<br>
Suddenly realizing something, Yuka looked over at Chisato and fell silent.<br>
Chisato had lost Shinji Mimura, the boy she loved, and now she stared down at the floor.<br>
Yuko hardly paid attention to this exchange as she took the wooden medical kit she found in the desk drawer.<br>
She placed it on the desk and opened it up.<br>
It was stuffed with various kinds of medical supplies, gauze, poultices.<br>
The only things missing were the bandages, since they were almost entirely used up to treat Shuya Nanahara.<br>
Painkillers… which one were the painkillers? Of course, it didn't matter.<br>
It didn't matter because…<br>
&quot;Wow, it smells great,&quot; she heard Yuka say, trying to change the mood.<br>
But she hardly paid noticed to that either.<br>
Painkillers… ah, here we go.<br>
Right here.<br>
For headaches, menstrual cramps, toothaches…oh…come to think of it, my stomach's been aching.<br>
I'll take some later.<br>
After things settle down a little.<br>
That's right, once things calm down.<br>
&quot;So what is it?&quot; Satomi asked Yukie in her slightly husky voice.<br>
&quot;That's right.<br>
What is it?&quot; Haruka asked.<br>
&quot;Oh, right.<br>
Let's see, where do I begin?&quot; Yukie said.<br>
It was only when Yuka said, &quot;Let's have a taste then,&quot; that Yuko suddenly looked up.<br>
She turned around…and saw Yuka lift the dish and put it against her mouth.<br>
She should have used the ladle if she wanted a taste.<br>
Instead she had to put her mouth against that dish, the one she'd sprinkled with the half-transparent powder.<br>
Yuko turned pale.<br>
She was about to raise her voice…but it happened too fast.<br>
Yuka dropped the dish and the stew splashed against the floor with a crashing sound.<br>
Everyone looked over at her.<br>
Yuka held onto her throat and coughed out the stew she had just swallowed.<br>
Then she coughed more violently onto the white table.<br>
Now the substance was bright red.<br>
The red splattered out in a circle against the white table and resembled the national flag of the Republic of Greater East Asia.<br>
And then she crashed onto the floor covered with stew.<br>
&quot;Yuka!&quot;<br>
Everyone — besides Yuko, who was speechless — cried out and ran to Yuka.<br>
Yuka balled up on her side and coughed up blood again.<br>
Her tan face became more and more pale.<br>
Red foam spilled out the side of her mouth.<br>
&quot;Yuka! Yuka! What happened!?&quot;<br>
Yukie shook her body, but the dark-red foam only continued to spill out the side of her mouth.<br>
Her eyes were open as wide as possible, as if on the verge of popping out, but now even the whites of her eyes were turning red.<br>
For some reason—inflammation or broken capillaries—dark-red and black spots began appearing all over her blue face, transforming it into the mask of some grotesque monster.<br>
But besides this, there was something else that was indisputable.<br>
It was obvious.<br>
Yuka had stopped breathing.<br>
Everyone fell silent.<br>
Yukie's trembling hand touched Yuka's throat.<br>
She said, &quot;She's dead…&quot;<br>
Behind Yukie, who crouched down beside Yuka and Haruka, Yuko stood still, her face completely pale.<br>
She was shaking.<br>
(Of course it was very possible the other four were also in the same state.) Oh, how could… how could this… this is all a mistake… mistake… how could… you only had a mouthful…how could it be this strong…I didn't…this is a mistake… I killed her… by mistake… it was a mistake… I didn't mean to…1 wanted to get rid of—<br>
&quot;It couldn't have been from food poisoning…could it?&quot; Yukie continued, her voice trembling.<br>
Chisato responded, &quot;I… just tasted it.<br>
Nothing happened… this… this… could this be…&quot;<br>
Haruka followed up, &quot;…poison?&quot;<br>
That sparked it off.<br>
Everyone (to be more accurate, it was everyone besides Yuko, but the other four didn't realize this) looked at each other.<br>
There was a thump.<br>
Satomi Noda had grabbed the Uzi and was now aiming it at the others.<br>
The other four, including Yuko, reflexively moved to the side or backed away from Yuka's corpse.<br>
Satomi screamed.<br>
Her eyes behind her glasses were wide open with fear.<br>
&quot;Who!? Who did it!? Who poisoned this stew! Who's the one trying to kill us!?&quot;<br>
&quot;Stop it!&quot; Yukie yelled.<br>
Yuko saw her hand reach for the gun (Browning High Power 9mm.<br>
This was Yukie's supplied weapon and because she was the team leader she held onto it) tucked in the back of her skirt.<br>
Yukie was about to move forward but stopped and stepped back.<br>
&quot;Put your gun down.<br>
That can't be.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh yes it can,&quot; Satomi shook her head.<br>
Satomi who always seemed so calm had completely lost control.<br>
&quot;The last announcement said there were only fourteen of us left.<br>
It's getting down to the wire.<br>
So our enemy's finally rearing its ugly head.&quot; Then she looked over at Haruka and said, &quot;You were the one cooking.&quot;<br>
Haruka shook her head violently.<br>
&quot;I wasn't the only one.<br>
Chisato also…&quot;<br>
&quot;That's horrible,&quot; Chisato said.<br>
&quot;I would never do such a horrible thing! Besides…&quot; She seemed to hesitate, but then she said, &quot;Satomi and Yuko also had plenty of chances to poison the food.&quot;<br>
&quot;…that's right,&quot; Haruka turned back to Satomi, then hissed at her, &quot;Aren't you getting a little too upset?&quot;<br>
&quot;Haruka!&quot; Yukie stopped her, but it was too late.<br>
Satomi was now completely upset.<br>
&quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right,&quot; Haruka continued, &quot;First of all, you've hardly slept.<br>
I know.<br>
When I got up in the middle of the night, you were up.<br>
Doesn't that mean you don't trust us? That's proof, right there!&quot;<br>
&quot;Please, stop it, Haruka!&quot; Yukie pleaded.<br>
She was nearly shrieking now.<br>
&quot;Satomi! Put down the gun!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, please.&quot; Satomi pointed the Uzi at Yukie now.<br>
&quot;Stop pretending you're the leader.<br>
So this is the act you put on after your plan to poison everyone goes awry? Is that it?&quot;<br>
&quot;Satomi…&quot; Yukie said desperately.<br>
Yuko raised her hand up to her mouth and stepped back in a daze.<br>
Her body was numb from the sudden turn of events.<br>
But…she had to say it, she had to explain the truth…or else this…something terrible was going to happen.<br>
Suddenly, Chisato moved…to the side table against the wall on the right side of the sink.<br>
There was the remaining gun—a Czechoslovakian CZ75.<br>
(It was in fact Yuka's weapon.) The rattling sound echoed through the room.<br>
Chisato was shot in the back three times as she crashed against the side table, slid down, clutched onto its edge, and fell face forward onto the floor.<br>
There was no need to check___She was dead.<br>
&quot;Satomi! What are you doing!?&quot; Yukie's eyes opened wide as she screamed.<br>
Her voice was breaking.<br>
&quot;Oh, please.&quot; Satomi held her smoking Uzi and glared at Yukie.<br>
&quot;She went for the gun.<br>
Because she was guilty.&quot;<br>
&quot;So did you though!&quot; Haruka screamed.<br>
&quot;Yukie! Shoot Satomi!&quot;<br>
With a clicking sound, Satomi pointed the Uzi at Haruka.<br>
Her face darkened.<br>
She seemed ready to shoot Haruka at any moment.<br>
Yukie looked anguished.<br>
At that moment she had her hand on the Browning in the back of her skirt.<br>
After hesitating, she must have…intended to shoot Satomi's arm or some other part of her body.<br>
Satomi then quickly shifted the Uzi and fired…at Yukie.<br>
Yukie was blown back with the rattling sound.<br>
Blood burst out of the holes in her chest and she fell backwards.<br>
Haruka stood still for only a moment and then made a dash for the Browning Yukie had dropped.<br>
Satomi's Uzi followed her body and burst out, blowing off Haruka's side along with the fabric of her uniform.<br>
Her body slid against the floor.<br>
The table was in between them now.<br>
Satomi pointed the Uzi at Yuko.<br>
She said, &quot;What about you?…You're different, right?&quot;<br>
Yuko could only tremble.<br>
As she trembled, her eyes were fixed on Satomi's face.<br>
There was a pop.<br>
There was a hole on the left side of Satomi's forehead.<br>
She opened her mouth…and looked down at her left hand.<br>
Blood burst out of the hole in her forehead, splashing against the inside of her glasses.<br>
Then it continued to drip downward.<br>
Yuko's neck moved stiffly like some gadget as she followed Satomi's eyes and found Haruka, her torso raised in pain from her fallen position, somehow still holding the Browning.<br>
Satomi's Uzi burst out.<br>
It wasn't clear whether she pulled the trigger intentionally or whether it was from her nerves twitching.<br>
Rows of bullets tore along the floor and pierced Haruka's body which got tossed over and back.<br>
A bloody mist burst upward, nearly tearing off Haruka's neck above her metal collar.<br>
Satomi's body fell forward slowly and landed with a thud over Yuka Nakagawa's corpse.<br>
She remained absolutely still.<br>
Completely alone in the room, Yuko just kept on trembling.<br>
Her body was stiff as a rock.<br>
With the look of a child wandering into a freakish museum exhibition, she gazed at the floor covered with the corpses of five of her classmates.<br>
9 students remaining<br>
63<br>
When he heard the shattering sound, Shuya just thought, oh, one of those clumsy girls must have dropped a dish, but when the sound was followed by an argument, he got up from his bed.<br>
He felt a sharp pain run through the left side of his stomach and his shoulder blade.<br>
Shuya groaned, but using his right arm he managed to get out of the bed and stepped onto the floor with his bare feet.<br>
He was only wearing his school uniform pants.<br>
The heated argument continued.<br>
He thought he heard Yukie shouting.<br>
Shuya walked over to the door and put his hand on the doorknob.<br>
The knob turned and as he pushed…the door seemed blocked.<br>
Through the one-centimeter gap he could see a wooden plank diagonally set against the door.<br>
As Yukie had warned him, they had constructed a makeshift bolt lock.<br>
Shuya grabbed the doorknob and shook it vigorously several times, but the door wouldn't budge.<br>
He poked his fingers through the gap, but the plank, set against the door, refused to move.<br>
On the verge of giving up, he took a deep breath when he heard the all-too-familiar rattling sound through the gap.<br>
There were several screams.<br>
Shuya turned pale.<br>
Were they being attacked…but if that was…in any case, something was wrong!<br>
Shuya managed to keep his injured body from tottering over.<br>
He raised his right foot and kicked the door with the heel of his bare foot, using the front kick technique he'd learned from Hiroki.<br>
But the door easily spurned his kick, throwing him off balance.<br>
He fell back onto the floor and felt a searing pain go up his side.<br>
He also realized he needed to pee, but that would have to wait.<br>
BRRATTA.<br>
More rattling.<br>
And then more BRRATTA.<br>
Shuya turned back to the bed, stood up, and lifted the edge of the bed that was made of steel pipes with his right hand.<br>
The bed landed on its side with a thud and the blanket and sheets slid off.<br>
Shuya dragged the bed, pressed one end against the door, and went around to the other end.<br>
He then shoved it against the door with all his might.<br>
The door made a cracking sound.<br>
One more shove.<br>
Bang.<br>
Gunfire.<br>
This time, one shot.<br>
The bed pummeled into the wooden door.<br>
The door bent in half with a crack and opened into the hall.<br>
Shuya yanked the bed from the front of the door with his right hand and let it fall against the floor.<br>
The typewriter-like rattling gunfire was now clearly audible through the open door.<br>
Shuya came out into the hall.<br>
The shades were drawn on the windows that had been nailed shut with wooden planks so the unlit hall was dim.<br>
The entrance was on his left.<br>
There were three doors down the hall on his right.<br>
The far door was slightly ajar, and light leaked into the hall, forming what looked like a cold puddle of light.<br>
Shuya picked up one of the longer pieces of broken planks in front of the door, approximately one meter long.<br>
He dragged his aching body down the hall.<br>
It was completely quiet now.<br>
What the hell happened?<br>
Did someone attack, or…<br>
Shuya cautiously approached the door.<br>
He peeked through the gap and saw the room with kitchen equipment where Yukie Utsumi and Haruka Tanizawa were sprawled out by the center table.<br>
Beyond them was Yuka Nakagawa (what's up with that face!).<br>
Chisato Matsui was against the wall on the right.<br>
Someone was lying face down in the shadow of the table.<br>
That someone had to be Satomi Noda, because the relatively thin body standing still with her back towards him and silky, straight, shoulder-length hair belonged to—unless Shuya was mistaken—Yuko Sakaki.<br>
There were several guns scattered around the collapsed bodies of Yukie's group.<br>
He was assaulted by the stench of blood splattered across the floor.<br>
Shuya froze in shock.<br>
That overwhelming numbness was identical to the way he felt when he saw Mayumi Tendo's body right in front of the school.<br>
What happened? How could this have happened? Yukie who had just said to him, &quot;You might want to listen to the girl who's in love with you,&quot; was lying over there.<br>
Four others had fallen too.<br>
Were they dead? Did they die?<br>
Yuko, her back facing Shuya, didn't have a gun.<br>
She was just standing still like a Venusian suddenly dropped onto Pluto.<br>
Shuya was in a daze as he slowly clutched the doorknob, opened the door, and stepped into the room.<br>
Yuko turn around.<br>
She gazed at Shuya with bloodshot eyes, but then went for the gun lying on the floor between Yukie and Haruka.<br>
Shuya also came out of his daze.<br>
He tossed the plank he'd been holding with his uninjured arm the way he'd pitch a perfect fastball in Little League.<br>
(He wasn't sure anymore whether such a game existed on earth.<br>
It seemed to take place on a distant planet in the remote Andromeda Galaxy where the inhabitants played this game using three arms out of five, although the use of one's tail was permitted in the final inning.)<br>
His body suddenly ached all over, and he grimaced.<br>
The plank hit the floor right in front of Yuko and bounced up.<br>
Yuko stopped as she shielded her face with her hand and fell back onto the bloody floor.<br>
Shuya dashed for the gun.<br>
He knew that in this chaos Yuko holding a gun would only make matters worse.<br>
Yuko shrieked and retreated.<br>
She got up, turned around, and ran to the other side of the room.<br>
She passed by the table and disappeared through an open door further down.<br>
There was a metallic clang.<br>
Were they…stairs?<br>
Shuya gazed over there for a moment after she disappeared.<br>
But then he dashed over to Yukie and knelt down beside her.<br>
He could tell her chest was ridden with holes.<br>
The blood was oozing out under her body already, and her eyes were shut peacefully as if she were sleeping.<br>
Her mouth was barely open—<br>
She wasn't breathing anymore.<br>
&quot;Ahh,&quot; Shuya cried.<br>
He reached out his uninjured right hand to her peaceful face.<br>
He felt tears welling up for the first time ever since the game began.<br>
Was it because they'd just talked minutes ago? Or was it because of what she'd said:<br>
&quot;I just wouldn't know what to do if you died....Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you?&quot;<br>
Her tearful but relieved face.<br>
Her melancholic face.<br>
And now her oddly peaceful face right beside him.<br>
He looked around.<br>
There was no need to check.<br>
Yuka Nakagawa's face had changed color.<br>
A bloody foam dripped from her mouth.<br>
Satomi Noda lay face down, a puddle of blood under her head.<br>
Chisato Matsui's back was covered with bullet holes, and Haruka Tanizawa…her neck was nearly torn off.<br>
How could…how could this be…<br>
Shuya looked back at Yukie.<br>
His nearly paralyzed left arm supported his right arm so he could hold her up.<br>
It might have been a meaningless gesture.<br>
But Shuya had to do it.<br>
As he held her body, he heard the blood dripping onto the floor from the holes in her chest.<br>
Her head hung back and her braided hair touched his arm.<br>
&quot;Do you understand what I'm saying?&quot;<br>
Shuya burst into tears as they fell onto her uniform.<br>
&quot;Ungh,&quot; Shuya bit his lip and gently let her down onto the floor.<br>
He picked up the Browning Yuko had attempted to grab.<br>
He walked to the door at the far end of the room where Yuko had gone.<br>
His body felt incredibly heavy.<br>
It wasn't just because he was injured.<br>
He wiped his eyes with his bare right arm, which was also holding the Browning.<br>
He entered.<br>
It was a cylindrical space made of bare concrete.<br>
The tower.<br>
This was the lighthouse.<br>
There was a thick steel column in the center and a spiral steel staircase winding around it.<br>
There were no windows, only a sliver of light from above.<br>
&quot;Yuko!&quot; Shuya yelled.<br>
He began climbing the stairs as he yelled, &quot;What happened, Yuko!?&quot;<br>
Yuko wasn't there at the top of the stairs.<br>
But…he heard the sound of her scream &quot;AIEEE&quot; echo through the cylindrical space of the tower.<br>
Shuya knit his brows…and began quickly climbing the stairs.<br>
The wound in his side began to ache.<br>
He thought he might be bleeding because his bandages now felt damp.<br>
9 students remaining<br>
64<br>
Yuko Sakaki ran out of breath as she climbed up the stairs to the top of the lighthouse.<br>
The Cyclops-like Fresnel lens was at the center of the landing, and there was enough space to move around it.<br>
She saw the cloudy sky beyond the windproof windows of the lantern room.<br>
On her left was a low door that led to a narrow balcony, and frantically she opened it.<br>
She was outside now.<br>
Maybe it was the height, but the wind was stronger than she'd expected.<br>
She caught a strong whiff of the sea breeze.<br>
The ocean was right there in front of her.<br>
Reflecting the cloudy sky, the sea was dull indigo, and the white waves were woven into it like some fabric.<br>
Yuko edged over to the right.<br>
The northern mountain was right in front of her.<br>
There was a small, open lot in front of the lighthouse building.<br>
On her left an unpaved road stretched out around the foot of the mountain, and there was a white light truck right by a barely functional gate in front of the road.<br>
Yuko held onto the steel handrailing around the balcony.<br>
The room she was inside only moments ago was down below.<br>
She saw the roof of the single-story building annex.<br>
Following the railing, she continued circling the lantern room, but didn't find what she thought she would—a steel ladder.<br>
Yuko never had the chance to keep watch so she didn't know the exterior of the lighthouse.<br>
There was no way out.<br>
She was standing, facing the sky.<br>
She was trapped now.<br>
Realizing this, she was about to panic, but she clenched her teeth and held herself together.<br>
If there was no ladder… then she'd have to jump.<br>
She was panting.<br>
She ended up returning to her previous position.<br>
She looked down again.<br>
It was high.<br>
It wasn't as bad as leaping to the ground, but it was still high.<br>
In fact, it might have been impossible to jump at this height, but before she could make a rational choice the image flashed across her mind again.<br>
This time it was her head, alone, split open.<br>
Blood spraying up.<br>
Shuya's face covered with its blood.<br>
She had to escape.<br>
No matter what.<br>
She just had to escape.<br>
She had no time to lose.<br>
Yuko crouched down and slid between the haphazardly installed steel fence.<br>
Its bars were widely spaced.<br>
She got through.<br>
Holding onto the railing from outside, she cautiously stood on the edge of the balcony barely ten centimeters wide, but…<br>
…the view below her feet made her dizzy.<br>
It was way too high…jumping down was out of the question…it was just way too high…<br>
Her view suddenly shook.<br>
Her feet slipped.<br>
The side of her shin hit the concrete edge of the balcony (she felt her skin scraping off), and Yuko's body flew out into the sky.<br>
&quot;AIEEE,&quot; Yuko shrieked.<br>
Simultaneously, her hands groped around and managed to grab a thin steel bar from the steel fence.<br>
Yuko's body hung from the edge of the balcony.<br>
Holding onto the railing, Yuko was panting.<br>
She nearly…nearly died.<br>
However, she took a deep breath and put all her might into her hands.<br>
First, that's right, first she had to lift her body up and get back to the other side of the railing.<br>
Then she would have to figure out some way to fight Shuya Nanahara.<br>
That was the only—<br>
The strong wind whistled by and shook her body.<br>
She shrieked, &quot;AIEEE,&quot; but it didn't do much.<br>
Her hands clutching onto the steel bar slipped, and now the palms of her hands barely managed to hold onto the edge of the balcony.<br>
Now she couldn't even reach for the steel bars.<br>
She was appalled to find her palms were oozing sweat.<br>
She was overcome with fear and panic.<br>
How, how, how, how could she be sweating now? Her hands…her hands were slipping___<br>
Her right pinky slipped off the edge of the balcony.<br>
&quot;No!&quot; Yuko screamed.<br>
Then her ring finger.<br>
Then her entire right hand fell off the railing (she felt the nail of her index finger catch, but it peeled off and that was that).<br>
Her body swung, her left hand now the fulcrum.<br>
And now her left hand too…<br>
&quot;Ahhhhhh—&quot; As she screamed, Yuko was overwhelmed with a dreamlike sensation that she was falling.<br>
But then she felt an impact run down her arm to her shoulder.<br>
Her fall came to a halt less than half a meter below.<br>
Swinging like a pendulum on her left arm, Yuko gazed up…and then saw Shuya Nanahara beyond the railing extending his body, stretching his right arm out, holding her wrist.<br>
For an instant Yuko gazed at Shuya's face, but then the next moment she screamed, &quot;No—!&quot;<br>
Of course if she let go she would die, but it was Shuya Nanahara holding her hand!<br>
&quot;No! No!&quot;<br>
Her eyes wide open, her hair tossed around, Yuko continued screaming as she wondered, why? Why are you trying to save me? Is it because you want to use me to survive? Or, oh, I get it.<br>
You want to kill me with your very own hands!<br>
&quot;No! Let me go!&quot; Yuko screamed.<br>
Any trace of rational thought had all but disappeared.<br>
&quot;No! I'd rather die here than let you kill me! Let me go! Let me go!&quot;<br>
Whatever he thought in reaction, or maybe he wasn't thinking at all, in any case, his expression stayed the same, and he yelled, &quot;Don't move!&quot;<br>
Yuko gazed up at Shuya again…and realized the bandage under the silver collar covering his neck wound oozed with blood now dripping down his bare shoulder.<br>
The blood dripped down his arm and reached her left hand.<br>
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Shuya moaned.<br>
He gripped Yuko's hand tighter.<br>
His face was breaking into a sweat.<br>
That's right, it wasn't just his neck, his entire body was covered with severe wounds.<br>
Given how he was not only holding her entire weight with his right arm but attempting to pull her up, he had to be in incredible pain.<br>
Yuko's jaw dropped.<br>
Why? Why would you try to save me when you're in so much pain? That's—<br>
Strangely enough, it suddenly all came to her.<br>
The black mist clouding her thoughts suddenly cleared as if blown away by the sea breeze blowing against her body.<br>
The image of Shuya holding the blood-soaked axe, looking down at Tatsumichi Oki's corpse, suddenly vanished as if shredded by the wind, and all her previous (although it was only two days ago) memories of the Third Year Class B classroom along with the cheerful expressions of Shuya Nanahara came back to her.<br>
How he joked around with his friends Yoshitoki Kuninobu and Shinji Mimura, how he looked so serious repeating a difficult guitar line while practicing in the music room, how he posed triumphantly at second base after making a perfect hit down the third base line during gym class, which she managed to see from the gym where she was playing volleyball.<br>
And then when she was pale from menstrual cramps, how he'd gently said to her, &quot;What's wrong, Yuko? You look pale,&quot; interrupted their English teacher Mr.<br>
Yamamoto, and called on the nurse's assistant, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi.<br>
How he looked so concerned then.<br>
Oh no.<br>
Yuko finally understood the situation.<br>
This is Shuya.<br>
Shuya is trying to save me.<br>
I…why? Why did I have to think I had to kill Shuya? Why did I believe that? It's Shuya.<br>
And I always thought he was kind of cool…that he was really nice but no—<br>
Then a different thought occurred to her.<br>
The action she took and its results.<br>
Yuko once again turned pale.<br>
I…my mind was all screwed up…and…and that's how I ended up—<br>
Yuko burst into tears.<br>
Shuya saw this and looked puzzled.<br>
&quot;Shuya!&quot; she screamed.<br>
&quot;I-it was me! I tried to kill you!&quot;<br>
Shuya looked surprised as Yuko looked up with despondent tears in her eyes.<br>
Yuko continued.<br>
&quot;I-I-I thought you'd killed Tatsumichi…! saw you two…and I was scared.<br>
I was so scared.<br>
So I tried poisoning your food…but Yuka ended up eating it…and then everyone…everyone…&quot;<br>
Shuya then understood everything.<br>
Hiding in a nearby bush, Yuko had seen him extract the axe from Tatsumichi Oki's head after fighting him.<br>
She didn't see how Kyoichi Motobuchi and Shogo appeared afterwards.<br>
She'd only witnessed that one moment.<br>
She could have interpreted it as an act of self defense on Shuya's part or as an accident, but Yuko was too frightened to trust Shuya.<br>
And so she poisoned the food to kill him, but Yuka ate this by mistake…and everyone panicked with suspicion.<br>
The culprit, Yuko, ended up being the only survivor…<br>
&quot;It's all right!&quot; Shuya shouted.<br>
&quot;It's all right, just don't move! I'll pull you up!&quot;<br>
Shuya was nearly lying flat on the balcony, his body jutting out between the bars, but because his left arm was useless, he couldn't grab onto the railing.<br>
Still, he twisted his body, and finally managed to tuck his right knee up to his body so he could rely on his back.<br>
He did his best to hold onto Yuko's wrist.<br>
The pain from the wounds all over his body, his side, his left shoulder, and the right side of his neck was mounting.<br>
But…<br>
Her face soaked with tears, Yuko shook her head.<br>
&quot;No.<br>
No.<br>
It was my fault everyone…everyone…&quot;<br>
she said, and suddenly her hand began to pry his fingers loose.<br>
The tight grip he'd finally managed to get on her came loose.<br>
Shuya gripped tighter in response, but…the blood dripping down from his neck suddenly made his hand slip.<br>
Yuko's hand left Shuya's.<br>
The weight on Shuya's arm suddenly vanished.<br>
Yuko's face looking up at Shuya receded—<br>
With a thud, Yuko fell on her back onto the roof of the single-story building below.<br>
Instead of slipping from his hand, she seemed to have appeared there suddenly via time-lapse photography.<br>
Her body wrapped in her sailor shirt and pleated skirt was sprawled out…and her neck was crooked, which made her head look oddly disjoined from the rest of her body.<br>
The top-right side of her head spurted out a red substance in the shape of a shriveled up maple leaf.<br>
&quot;Ah…&quot;<br>
Shuya stared down at her, his right arm still hanging over the balcony.<br>
8 students remaining<br>
65<br>
Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No.<br>
11) took a deep breath.<br>
He'd heard the rapid gunfire approximately ten minutes ago.<br>
He'd been wandering around the northern mountain, but he quickly headed east toward the shots.<br>
Then…by the time he arrived it was already quiet at the lighthouse.<br>
He knew it was there from the map, but he assumed Kayoko Kotohiki would never hide there alone in such a conspicuous location, so he'd ignored it until now.<br>
He wasn't sure whether this was where the gunfire occurred.<br>
He looked down from the cliff over the lighthouse and saw a girl lying on the roof of the brick annex by the lighthouse.<br>
Even from a distance he could make out the red color…and see that she was dead.<br>
The short hair and petite body resembled Kotohiki, as Megumi Eto's corpse did when he discovered it.<br>
He slid down the edge of the cliff.<br>
As he descended, the corpse on the roof disappeared from view.<br>
He reached the front entrance of the lighthouse.<br>
There was a pile of chairs and desks beyond the open door.<br>
Someone had formed a barricade, but for some reason this barricade was also torn down.<br>
He looked at the window that was sealed shut with planks and cautiously walked down the hall.<br>
(There was a room with a bed right by the entrance, and for some reason its door had been knocked down.) His detector responded.<br>
Six.<br>
Hiroki proceeded cautiously—<br>
And stood frozen in the room splattered with blood.<br>
The bodies of five girls were scattered all over what appeared to be a kitchen.<br>
There was the female student representative Yukie Utsumi on her back by the center table.<br>
To her right was Haruka Tanizawa, her head nearly torn off (!).<br>
And further down Yuka Nakagawa, whose face had turned nearly black.<br>
Chisato Matsui was lying face down in front of the side table to his right, her pale blue face turned his way.<br>
And then one more girl was lying face down behind the table, covered in blood.<br>
The four girls, including Yukie, were clearly dead.<br>
But this one whose face he couldn't see was…<br>
Hiroki cautiously checked the room once again.<br>
He listened for any sounds beyond the opened door on the other side of the room.<br>
There didn't seem to be anyone else hiding.<br>
He tucked the gun in his left hand in back, walked between the bodies of Yukie Utsumi and Haruka Tanizawa, passed by Yuka Nakagawa's body, and walked around the table.<br>
The soles of his shoes splashed against the blood all over the floor.<br>
He crouched down beside the girl lying face down, put aside the stick in his right hand, and lifted her body.<br>
He felt a sharp pain from the wound in his right shoulder where Mitsuko Souma had struck him.<br>
The gunshot wound Toshinori Oda had inflicted on his thigh though was only a scrape, so there wasn't much bleeding or pain there.<br>
Hiroki tried to ignore the pain, in any case.<br>
He turned over the body.<br>
It was Satomi Noda.<br>
There was a red hole in the left side of her forehead, and her glasses, though crooked, managed to stay on her face.<br>
The left lens probably shattered when she fell.<br>
Of course she was dead.<br>
Hiroki put her down and looked over at the opened door on the far side of the room.<br>
That was where the tower was.<br>
That led up to the lantern room.<br>
The other person on the detector was that girl on the roof.<br>
She was no doubt dead as well, but he had to check and make sure…as long as she resembled Kayoko Kotohiki.<br>
Hiroki took his gun and entered through the door.<br>
There was a steel staircase.<br>
He quickly climbed them with hushed footsteps.<br>
Someone might still be up there.<br>
He held the stick and radar in his right hand, checking it as he went up.<br>
There were no new responses as he came out into the lantern room.<br>
Hiroki put the radar in his pocket, tucked his gun also in back, and came out onto the balcony around the lantern room.<br>
He put his hand on the steel railing.<br>
He took a deep breath, leaned over the railing, and looked down.<br>
There was the corpse in the sailor suit.<br>
Her neck was twisted in an odd way and blood spread out from under her head but the corpse…wasn't Kayoko Kotohiki's.<br>
It was Yuko Sakaki.<br>
Still…<br>
He gazed at the sea.<br>
There was a strong breeze.<br>
Six girls had all died here at once.<br>
There were no guns in the room, but given how they were wounded and how the walls and floors were ridden with bullet holes, he was certain the gunshots he'd heard had occurred here.<br>
The most logical scenario was that…the girls somehow got together and cooped themselves up here, but then someone attacked them.<br>
The five girls were shot down there first, and then Yuko Sakaki managed to get this far and fell to her death without being attacked by the assailant.<br>
Then the assailant left before Hiroki got here....<br>
But given how they'd formed a barricade at the entrance—the planks nailed over the windows, every entry point probably sealed—why would they tear the barricade down? Did the assailant shove it away as he left? But then how could he or she have entered in the first place? Could it be…there were seven of them? And one of them had suddenly betrayed the rest—no, revealed his or her true intentions? No, that can't be...The other thing was that Yuka Nakagawa didn't look like she died from gunshots.<br>
She looked like…she'd been choked.<br>
The blood splattered all over the table also didn't make any sense.<br>
How could that large amount of blood end up there? There was more.<br>
The door to that room right next to the entrance.<br>
Why was it torn down?<br>
There was no use trying to figure it out.<br>
Hiroki shook his head, checked the roof of the building, and returned to the lantern room.<br>
As he descended the steel spiral staircase in the dim tower and gazed at the inner walls of the lighthouse, Hiroki felt a light sensation of vertigo as if the spiral movement of the stairs were internalized.<br>
It might have been from fatigue, but still…<br>
So now there were six students less.<br>
Sakamochi said there were fourteen students left, as of the noon announcement.<br>
Then there were at most eight students left now.<br>
Was Kayoko Kotohiki still alive? Wasn't it possible she might have died between noon and now in some area he didn't know about?<br>
No, Hiroki thought, she has to be alive.<br>
Even though he could hardly justify it, for some reason he was nearly certain.<br>
Eight students remaining, possibly even less.<br>
But I'm alive, and so must be Kotohiki.<br>
This is taking too much time.<br>
It's been a day and a half since the game began, and I still haven't managed to find Kotohiki.<br>
But…I will eventually.<br>
Once again he was nearly certain.<br>
Then he thought of Shuya's trio.<br>
None of their three names had been announced.<br>
Shogo Kawada had said, &quot;If you're up for it, you can come aboard our train.&quot;<br>
…was there really a way out? And would he really be able to reach that station with Kotohiki? He wasn't sure.<br>
But at the very least he wanted Kotohiki to board that train.<br>
Shall I offer you a hand then, mademoiselle?<br>
It sounded like something Shinji Mimura would have said.<br>
Now he saw how Shinji could be good friends with Yutaka Seto.<br>
Shinji liked to kid around.<br>
The jokes were different from Yutaka's, of course.<br>
They were more sarcastic and at times biting.<br>
Shinji seemed to value &quot;the importance of laughing it off.&quot; At the closing ceremony before New Year's, when they were in their second year, during the regional education representative's dull speech, Shinji said, &quot;My uncle once said laughter is essential to maintain harmony, and that that might be our only release.<br>
Do you understand that, Hiroki? I still can't quite get it.&quot;<br>
Although he could relate to it a little, he also felt he didn't fully get it.<br>
It might have been because he was young.<br>
But in any case Shinji Mimura and Yutaka Seto were both dead now.<br>
He could no longer give Shinji a reply.<br>
As he pondered these thoughts, soon enough he was back in the kitchen filled with five bodies.<br>
Once again Hiroki looked over the room covered in blood.<br>
He hadn't noticed because of the stench, but now he saw the gas stove pot and caught a whiff of the appetizing odor.<br>
There was no gas of course, so they were probably in the middle of cooking using solid fuel.<br>
He went to take a look.<br>
The flame under the pot was out, but there was still steam rising from what looked like stew.<br>
Ever since the game began he'd only had the bread the government had supplied (when he ran out of water he retrieved some from a house well), so he was famished, but he shook his head and peeled his eyes off the pot.<br>
He just couldn't bring himself to eat it.<br>
Not in this terrible room.<br>
Besides, he had to hurry…and find Kotohiki.<br>
Hurry up…and leave.<br>
He staggered out into the hall.<br>
Not having slept at all, he was feeling dizzy.<br>
Someone was standing at the entrance at the far end of the long corridor.<br>
Because the hall was dim, this person looked like a silhouette outlined from behind by the light.<br>
Hiroki leaped to his side before his eyes could even open wide and crashed his way into the kitchen.<br>
All at the same time, flames came bursting from the silhouette's hands.<br>
A row of bullets raced past the tips of Hiroki's feet flying out of the hall.<br>
Hiroki grimaced from the sudden surprise.<br>
He got up, crouched, and then closed the door and locked it.<br>
The gunfire sounded familiar.<br>
It was the sound he'd heard before and after that incredible explosion.<br>
After he escaped Toshinori Oda, he heard the sound of gunfire behind him…in other words it was whatever killed Toshinori Oda.<br>
It was also the gunfire he'd heard when Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano were killed.<br>
He'd heard the gunfire several other times.<br>
It all came from &quot;that classmate.&quot; Like Hiroki, the assailant had probably come here after hearing gunfire.<br>
Or maybe the student was here to kill the assailant who'd killed Yukie Utsumi's group.<br>
Or maybe—the assailant himself was returning.<br>
Kneeling down on the floor, Hiroki reached around his back and gripped his gun with his left hand.<br>
He'd found the bullets in the day pack Mitsuko left behind, so it was now fully loaded, but he couldn't find an extra magazine.<br>
Maybe Mitsuko had put it in her pocket.<br>
Colt Government .45 Single-Action Automatic.<br>
Seven rounds in the magazine, plus one in the chamber.<br>
He couldn't afford to reload the bullets individually.<br>
The moment he did he'd be wasted by the assailant's machine gun or any other gun on him or her.<br>
His back against the wall, Hiroki looked at the kitchen where the girls' corpses were.<br>
Unfortunately, the windows were sealed with planks from the inside.<br>
It would take too much time to tear them off and escape.<br>
He looked over at the door leading to the tower.<br>
No, that was impossible.<br>
It was too high for him to jump off the top of the lighthouse.<br>
It would be insane.<br>
He'd end up sun bathing right next to Yuko Sakaki.<br>
No, wait…what was this &quot;someone&quot; trying to do? Was he tiptoeing behind the door, approaching, or was he taking his time waiting for Hiroki to come out? No, he had to be in a rush too.<br>
He had to get rid of Hiroki before he might be shot from behind by someone else arriving as a result of the gunfire—<br>
Hiroki was right.<br>
The wood around the doorknob was blown to bits.<br>
(In fact, several of the bullets exiting the door tore off the shoulder and side of Chisato Matsui, who was lying directly in front of the door.) The door crashed open.<br>
The dark figure leaped into the room.<br>
As it tumbled over once and got up, Hiroki realized it was Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No.<br>
6).<br>
Ignoring the corpses in the room, he pointed his machine gun to the side of the door which was his blind spot, and immediately began firing away.<br>
After five or six bullets tore through the wall…the gunfire stopped…because he saw no one there.<br>
Now was his chance.<br>
Hiroki swung his stick up and leaped onto Kazuo Kiriyama from above.<br>
At the last instant he'd decided to climb to the top of the high shelf installed beside the door.<br>
He'd decided against using the gun since he wasn't used to it and had tucked it away again.<br>
The important thing was to stop the assailant—who turned out to be Kazuo Kiriyama—from shooting anymore.<br>
Kazuo responded by looking up.<br>
He lifted the muzzle of his machine gun, but the handle of the broom Hiroki held struck Kazuo's wrist.<br>
The Ingram M10 9mm crashed onto the floor, slid, and stopped beyond the table where Satomi Noda was.<br>
Kazuo tried to pull out another gun (it was a large automatic pistol, different from the revolver Toshinori Oda had), but Hiroki, who'd landed and balanced himself, quickly swung the tip of his stick and struck this gun down too.<br>
A rapid assault! I'll strike him down!<br>
The stick came swinging down, but Kazuo quickly bent back and somersaulted backwards.<br>
He leaped over Yukie Utsumi's body with the grace of a kung fu master, and after tumbling once he was standing in front of the center table.<br>
By the time he was standing he had a revolver in his right hand, the one that belonged to Toshinori Oda.<br>
But even Kazuo couldn't have foreseen Hiroki's agility.<br>
He'd immediately moved within eighty centimeters of Kazuo.<br>
&quot;Yahh!&quot; Hiroki swung his stick, striking the gun in Kazuo's hand three times.<br>
It flew into the air.<br>
Before it landed on the floor, the other end of Hiroki's stick swung at Kazuo's face.<br>
There was a table behind Kazuo.<br>
He couldn't retreat anymore.<br>
But—the stick stopped several centimeters before hitting Kazuo's face.<br>
A third of the stick flew by Kazuo's face.<br>
Strangely enough, he only heard it crack later.<br>
Kazuo had chopped off the stick with his left hand.<br>
The next moment, Kazuo formed a spear fist with his right hand to strike Hiroki in the face.<br>
He was aiming for Hiroki's eyes.<br>
It was a miracle he managed to duck and dodge it.<br>
That was how fast Kazuo's fist was.<br>
But Hiroki had managed to dodge it.<br>
When he dodged it, he grabbed Kazuo's wrist with his hand that had dropped the stick.<br>
The next moment, he twisted his wrist back.<br>
Simultaneously, he kneed Kazuo in the stomach with all his might.<br>
The absolutely calm Kazuo gasped slightly.<br>
With his left hand restraining Kazuo's arm, Hiroki pulled out his gun and cocked the hammer back.<br>
He pressed the gun against Kazuo's stomach and pulled the trigger.<br>
He kept on pulling the trigger until he used up all his bullets.<br>
With every shot Kazuo's body flinched.<br>
When the gun's breechblock held up, the eighth shell fell onto the floor with a clink, rolled, and then clicked against another shell.<br>
He could feel Kazuo's right arm and the rest of his body slowly going limp.<br>
His slicked-back hair and the rest of his head fell forward.<br>
Once Hiroki let go, Kazuo's body would slide against corner of the table and fall onto the floor.<br>
But right now Hiroki stood still facing Kazuo as if dancing a strange dance, panting, his chest heaving.<br>
I won.<br>
He won against the Kazuo Kiriyama.<br>
The Kazuo Kiriyama whose athletic prowess was probably superior to Shinji Mimura or Shuya Nanahara's, who'd never lost a fight as far as he knew.<br>
He'd defeated him.<br>
I defeated—<br>
Suddenly a sharp pain pierced the right side of Hiroki's stomach.<br>
He groaned, gasped…then opened his eyes wide.<br>
Kazuo was looking up at Hiroki.<br>
And in his left hand…was a knife digging into Hiroki's stomach.<br>
Hiroki slowly shifted his eyes from this hand over to Kazuo's face.<br>
Kazuo stared back with eyes that were as always beautiful and cold.<br>
How…could he still be alive?<br>
Of course it was because Kazuo Kiriyama was wearing Toshinori Oda's bulletproof vest, but Hiroki couldn't have known, and right now there wasn't much point trying to figure this out.<br>
Kazuo twisted the knife and Hiroki moaned.<br>
His left hand's grip on Kazuo's right wrist was loosening.<br>
Oh no, this is not good…at all.<br>
But Hiroki managed to squeeze some strength out into his arm.<br>
He swung down his right hand that was still holding the emptied gun.<br>
His bent right elbow struck Kazuo's lower chin.<br>
Kazuo flew back and slid across the white table covered with blood.<br>
The blood stain that resembled the Republic of Greater East Asia's national flag now looked more like the stripes of the American flag.<br>
Simultaneously, the knife in Hiroki's stomach, after tearing off approximately thirty grams of Hiroki's flesh, was torn out.<br>
Blood came bursting out.<br>
Hiroki gasped, but immediately turned on his heel and ran to the door leading out to the hall.<br>
Right as he was entering it he heard gunfire, and the door frame cracked open.<br>
Kazuo didn't have any time to pick up the guns scattered on the floor.<br>
So he must have had a fourth gun (probably attached under his pants, tied to his ankle or something).<br>
Hiroki ran, ignoring the gunfire.<br>
He leaped over the scattered pile of chairs and desks.<br>
Right before he emerged outside he heard that all-too-familiar machine gun fire, but the shots missed him because he was crouched over.<br>
The sky was cloudy enough to expect rain, but for some reason it looked bright to him.<br>
Hiroki ran as fast as he could into the grove beyond the gate where the light truck was parked.<br>
He left behind a trail of red spots on the white sand.<br>
He heard the machine gun rattle again, but by then he'd leaped into the grove.<br>
Of course he couldn't afford to rest now.<br>
8 students remaining<br>
66<br>
It began to drizzle.<br>
Rain washed over the bushes covering the island, and in the dim light a dark sheen fell through the drops of water and thick clouds.<br>
Shuya slowly wove his way through the bushes.<br>
The area to his right was open and offered him a view of the sea, which was dull gray behind the white curtain of rain.<br>
He now wore his shirt, school coat, and sneakers, which he found in the room where Yukie's group was.<br>
Raindrops falling off tree branches dripped onto his coat.<br>
He had the Uzi slung over his shoulder, his right hand on the grip, and kept the CZ75 tucked in front.<br>
The Browning and the bullets he'd collected were inside the day pack on his shoulder.<br>
Shuya left the lighthouse immediately, and as he'd expected fifteen minutes later, right when he began collecting wood to build a fire on a cliff near the northern tip of the island, he heard gunfire coming from the lighthouse.<br>
Despite the fact that the massacre of Yukie's group had occurred inside the lighthouse, he surmised at least two students had arrived upon hearing the shots and ended up fighting.<br>
After some hesitation, Shuya started heading back to the lighthouse.<br>
It sounded like the all-too-familiar gunfire of Kazuo Kiriyama's machine gun.<br>
He doubted Noriko and Shogo would go out of their way to follow the gunfire, but there weren't too many students left.<br>
Supposing one was Kazuo, there was a good chance the other was Hiroki Sugimura.<br>
Of course, it also could have been Mitsuko Souma.<br>
But the gunfire ceased immediately.<br>
Shuya stopped.<br>
He decided not to return to the lighthouse after all.<br>
Even if he went back, there wouldn't be anyone there.<br>
Or at best there might be another corpse in addition to the bodies of Yukie's group.<br>
It began raining when Shuya had finished preparing two fires on the cliff rock.<br>
He found a lighter in the lighthouse, but it was difficult to get the fire going because of the rain.<br>
The rain grew heavy, so Shuya gave up and left the area.<br>
Noriko and Shogo probably hadn't moved much.<br>
C=3 was forbidden, but the adjacent D=3 and C=4 were still safe.<br>
They were probably in that area, so he could make another fire once he was in the vicinity.<br>
With this thought in mind he began walking.<br>
That was when we heard the distant chirping sound of a bird as he turned westward on the north shore of the island around 2:30 p.m.<br>
Shuya listened closely…and quickly glanced down at his watch.<br>
The seconds hand moved seven degrees, and the faint chirping stopped.<br>
Shogo had said fifteen seconds.<br>
Given the time it took for him to look at his watch, its duration corresponded to that length of time.<br>
Besides, he doubted there were many birds chirping in the rain.<br>
And he heard none of those little birds that he'd heard during the day ever since the game began.<br>
Shuya continued along the northwest shore of the island—and once again heard the same chirping.<br>
This time it was clear.<br>
Exactly fifteen minutes had elapsed since the last one—and it stopped exactly fifteen seconds later.<br>
It was Shogo.<br>
There was no need for the smoke signal.<br>
Shogo was using the bird call.<br>
The third fake chirping occurred only three minutes ago.<br>
It sounded close.<br>
According to the map, Shuya was moving from B=6 to B=5.<br>
Shuya rested a little, tucked the Uzi's barrel under his left wrist, and lifted his left arm.<br>
It was easier that way because he didn't have to exert his muscles.<br>
The watch hands, out of focus from the raindrops against the glass, indicated it was 3:05 p.m.<br>
The chirping sounded closer to the mountain than it was to the sea.<br>
Shuya glanced at the sea, then moved towards and then up the gentle slope.<br>
As he looked up, he noticed that the northern mountain in front of him looked different, which made him realize he'd been moving along the foot of the mountain and was now approaching the western shore.<br>
Just a little more.<br>
He'd barely covered 1.5 kilometers, but he still felt woozy from all the blood he'd lost.<br>
The pain in his body was so severe he felt like throwing up (he really had to stop and rest).<br>
But he was almost there.<br>
Almost.<br>
He made his way through the grove and his fatigue became overwhelming.<br>
Of course…he could be attacked at any point from the bushes.<br>
But he couldn't afford to worry about that.<br>
If that happened…he would just have to pull the trigger of the Uzi.<br>
The low bushes became sparse and then were cut off.<br>
Shuya stood still.<br>
It wasn't as if there was someone holding a gun… but there was something strange in this narrow opening.<br>
At first it looked like two stiff gray clumps to Shuya.<br>
On top of that, they seemed to be moving.<br>
He stared at them.<br>
There were black pants and sneakers poking out of these two clumps.<br>
He realized they were corpses.<br>
Two boys had died here.<br>
A flash of red color flew up from the stiff gray clump and cried, &quot;KAW!&quot; It was a large heron-sized bird, its head drenched in red.<br>
The birds were feeding on the corpses!<br>
Shuya reflexively raised his Uzi at them.<br>
He put his finger against the trigger—but decided against it.<br>
He walked over.<br>
The birds flapped their wings and flew away from the two corpses.<br>
Shuya stood still in the rain by them…and lifted his right hand up to his mouth.<br>
He felt a sudden urge to vomit.<br>
It was a chilling sight.<br>
The birds had picked away at their exposed faces.<br>
Their red flesh broke out of their skin.<br>
They were covered in blood.<br>
Shuya held back his nausea and somehow managed to look at them.<br>
He saw they were probably Tadakatsu Hatagami and Yuichiro Takiguchi.<br>
Then he noticed something about Tadakatsu's face, which was in worse condition than Yuichiro's.<br>
The birds weren't responsible for his deformed skull.<br>
His nose, unharmed by the birds, was also crushed.<br>
He looked around and found a bat lying on the grass.<br>
Even though it was washed by the rain, the tip of the bat was still tinged with red.<br>
Given the state of Tadakatsu's face, he was most likely beaten to death.<br>
With the gear of his sport— a baseball bat.<br>
Compared to him, Yuichiro's face was in relatively good shape.<br>
Of course… Shuya had a feeling his lips and eyeballs were gone by now.<br>
One of the birds landed on top of Tadakatsu's face.<br>
Then several more birds came by.<br>
Given how Shuya remained frozen, they probably assumed they were safe.<br>
Safe? You got to be kidding!<br>
Shuya once again put his finger on the trigger of the Uzi…but restrained himself.<br>
The important thing was for him to get back to Shogo and Noriko.<br>
More birds reappeared.<br>
Were they feeding on the other bodies sprawled all over the island? Or was it just because they were near the sea?<br>
Peeling his eyes off the two corpses, Shuya staggered around them and entered the bushes ahead.<br>
He heard the birds cry, &quot;KAW!&quot;<br>
As he moved, he felt the urge to vomit once again.<br>
By now he was getting used to people dying, but the thought of these birds, these sky rats, feeding on them…I'll never sit on the beach and gaze peacefully at seagulls again.<br>
Even if I write my own songs, I'll never ever sing about birds.<br>
I might not even be able to eat chicken for a while.<br>
Man, birds… suck.<br>
But then he heard that chirping sound again.<br>
He looked up.<br>
Large raindrops hit his face.<br>
Ah—birds suck but…I guess a little bird's all right, huh?<br>
Another full fifteen seconds passed and the chirping ceased.<br>
This time it sounded really close.<br>
Shuya looked around.<br>
The bushes continued along the gentle slope.<br>
It must be…around here.<br>
They had to be somewhere near here.<br>
But…where?<br>
Before he could think, the nausea he'd held back surged up.<br>
The two corpses, their faces messed up.<br>
And their soft flesh would be the birds' afternoon snack.<br>
Yummy.<br>
I can't puke.<br>
I'm weak enough as it is…but…<br>
Shuya knelt down on the ground and vomited.<br>
Because he hadn't had anything to eat, it was all gastric juices.<br>
There was a sharp, acidic stench.<br>
Shuya threw up more.<br>
A pinkish substance was mixed into the yellow liquid like a drop of paint.<br>
For all he knew, his stomach might be screwed up by now.<br>
&quot;Shuya.&quot;<br>
He looked up.<br>
Reflexively, he pointed the Uzi over there.<br>
But the muzzle fell again.<br>
Between the shrubs he saw that thuggish face.<br>
It was Shogo.<br>
In his left hand, Shogo held a bow which seemed to be carved out of wood, and in his right hand he was about to put down the arrow fixed to the bow.<br>
That was when Shuya realized, oh, I get it, I must have gotten caught on Shogo's tripwire.<br>
&quot;Hangover, huh?&quot; Shogo said.<br>
His humorous remark was tinged with kindness.<br>
There was a rustling sound.<br>
Noriko appeared behind Shogo.<br>
She gazed at Shuya through her rain-drenched hair, her eyes and mouth trembling.<br>
Pushing Shogo aside, Noriko dragged her leg as she ran to him.<br>
Shuya wiped his mouth and staggered up.<br>
He released the Uzi and extended only his right hand, hugging Noriko.<br>
On impact Noriko's body sent a jolt of pain through his side, but he didn't care.<br>
They were having their reunion right above some fresh puke, but that didn't matter either.<br>
Her body against him felt warm in the cold rain.<br>
Noriko looked up.<br>
&quot;Shuya…Shuya…I'm so glad…I'm so glad…&quot; She was crying.<br>
Tears came streaming out of the corners of her eyes along with the raindrops falling against her face.<br>
Shuya gently smiled.<br>
Then he realized he was on the verge of crying too.<br>
Too many people have died…too many people have died in this game, but how wonderful, how incredibly wonderful these two were still alive.<br>
Shogo came up to him and offered his right hand.<br>
For a moment Shuya was puzzled by the gesture…but then he understood.<br>
He reached out his hand over Noriko's shoulder and held it.<br>
It was, as always, a large, solid hand.<br>
&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Shogo said warmly.<br>
8 students remaining<br>
67<br>
Exposed rocks appeared where the woods headed toward the sea.<br>
Now a low wall formation of those rocks faced the sea.<br>
Shogo seemed to have worked on it with his knife.<br>
Two large branches had been stuck into the rock wall, and on top of them were leafy branches serving as a roof to block the rain.<br>
Raindrops came flowing off the branch tips.<br>
After he was given strong painkillers that Shogo had brought from the medical clinic, Shuya told him about the lighthouse.<br>
Shogo boiled water in a can with charcoal, and its gurgling sound overlapped with the sound of pouring rain.<br>
When Shuya was done, Shogo said, &quot;I see.&quot; He took a deep breath, and put another Wild Seven into his mouth.<br>
He held the Uzi in his lap.<br>
They decided it was best Shogo hold onto it.<br>
Shuya held the CZ75, and Noriko had the Browning.<br>
Shuya shook his head feebly.<br>
&quot;It was awful.&quot;<br>
Shogo blew out some smoke and removed the cigarette from his mouth.<br>
&quot;Yukie forming such a large group ended up backfiring.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded bitterly.<br>
&quot;It's so hard to…trust someone.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Shogo looked down.<br>
&quot;It's very hard.&quot; He continued smoking and appeared pensive.<br>
Then he said, &quot;In any case, I'm glad you made it.&quot;<br>
Shuya recalled Yukie's face.<br>
He was alive.<br>
He was alive thanks to Yukie's group, but they were gone now.<br>
Shuya looked at Noriko, on his left.<br>
Hearing about the deaths of her friends Yukie Utsumi and Haruka Tanizawa must have been hard on her.<br>
Once she saw the water was boiling, she took out some dried bouillon Shogo must have found and tossed two cubes into the can.<br>
The smell of broth came drifting up.<br>
&quot;Can you eat, Shuya?&quot; Noriko asked.<br>
Shuya looked at Noriko and raised his brow.<br>
He knew he had to eat, but he had just thrown up—and besides the images of the stiff gray lumps around Tadakatsu Hatagami and Yuichiro Takiguchi still flashed through his mind.<br>
(He hadn't told them about that.<br>
The &quot;lumps&quot; were at work only a hundred meters or so away from them__He only said that he threw up from the pain of his wounds.) He couldn't work up an appetite.<br>
&quot;Eat, Shuya.<br>
Noriko and I already had lunch,&quot; Shogo said, cigarette in mouth.<br>
His stubble had thickened.<br>
He grabbed the edge of the can with a handkerchief, poured the soup into a plastic cup, and offered it to Shuya.<br>
Shuya took it and slowly put it against his mouth.<br>
The taste of broth spread through his mouth.<br>
Then the warm liquid slid down his throat and into his stomach.<br>
It wasn't as bad as he'd expected.<br>
Noriko offered him bread.<br>
Shuya took a bite.<br>
Once he started chewing, he was surprised to find he could eat.<br>
He ended up eating it all instantly.<br>
Regardless of the mental state he was in…his body had been starving.<br>
&quot;Would you like more?&quot; Noriko asked and Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;A little more soup.&quot; He raised the empty cup.<br>
Noriko refilled it this time.<br>
Taking the cup, Shuya said, &quot;Noriko.&quot;<br>
She looked up at him.<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
&quot;Are you feeling all right now?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; She smiled.<br>
&quot;I've been taking cold medicine.<br>
I'm fine.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked at the side of Shogo's face.<br>
Shogo nodded, cigarette dangling between lips.<br>
He'd taken another antibiotic syringe kit from the medical clinic, but it turned out that was unnecessary.<br>
Shuya turned around to Noriko again and smiled back at her.<br>
&quot;That's great.&quot;<br>
Then she asked the same question she'd been repeating over and over.<br>
&quot;Shuya, are you really all right?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;I'm fine.&quot;<br>
In fact, he wasn't, but what else could he say? He could see over his cuffs how his left hand had grown pale compared to his right hand.<br>
He wasn't sure whether it was due to his shoulder wound or elbow wound.<br>
Or it might simply be because the bandage was too tight around his elbow.<br>
He felt his left arm get stiffer and stiffer.<br>
He had another sip of the soup and put the cup down by his feet.<br>
Then he called Shogo.<br>
Shogo, who was checking the Uzi, raised his brow and looked at Shuya.<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's about Kazuo.&quot;<br>
That's right.<br>
As he contemplated the events that had occurred since yesterday, the question that had been occupying him right before he split up with Shogo and Noriko suddenly came back to him.<br>
The gunfire he'd heard right after he left the lighthouse also reminded him.<br>
In other words—as he'd yelled out before,<br>
&quot;What's the hell's he doing!?&quot;—meaning, what kind of person was Kazuo Kiriyama?<br>
As far as he could tell, Kazuo wasn't the only one willing to participate.<br>
Tatsumichi Oki, whom Shuya had fought, possibly Yoshio Akamatsu, and if Hiroki was right, Mitsuko Souma might also be in the same category.<br>
But…Kazuo was absolutely merciless.<br>
His coldness and calmness.<br>
The strange vibe he always got from Kazuo suddenly exploded in this game and assaulted them.<br>
Shuya once again recalled the flames erupting from the machine gun, and the cold eyes behind them.<br>
He felt a chill run down his spine.<br>
Shogo remained silent, so Shuya continued, &quot;What…what's up with him? I just don't get it.&quot;<br>
Shogo looked down and tinkered around with the Uzi's safety device, equipped with a full-auto/semi-auto switch.<br>
Didn't Shogo say there was no need to understand? Shuya wondered whether Shogo would give him the same reply.<br>
But Shogo had a different response this time.<br>
He looked up.<br>
&quot;I've seen people like him before.&quot;<br>
&quot;In the previous game?&quot;<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Shogo shook his head.<br>
&quot;Not there.<br>
Totally outside of this game.<br>
You see a lot of things when you're the son of a doctor working in the slums.&quot; Shogo took out another cigarette and lit it.<br>
He exhaled and said, &quot;A hollow man.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hollow?&quot; Noriko asked.<br>
&quot;That's right,&quot; Shogo nodded.<br>
&quot;There's no place in his heart for logic or love, no.<br>
For any kind of values.<br>
That kind of person.<br>
On top of that…there's no reason for the way he is.&quot;<br>
No reason, Shuya thought, or did he mean he was just born that way? That's—<br>
Shogo took a puff and exhaled.<br>
&quot;Hiroki warned us about Mitsuko Souma, right?&quot;<br>
Shuya and Noriko nodded.<br>
&quot;We still haven't seen for ourselves whether Mitsuko's really up for this game.<br>
But from what little I've seen at school, I think Mitsuko and Kazuo are similar.<br>
The only difference is that Mitsuko's abandoned all reason and love.<br>
There was probably something behind that.<br>
I have no idea what it was.<br>
But Kazuo doesn't have any cause.<br>
The difference is crucial.<br>
There's no explanation behind Kazuo.&quot;<br>
Shuya stared at Shogo and mumbled, &quot;That's scary.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, it's scary,&quot; Shogo agreed.<br>
&quot;Just think about it.<br>
It's probably not even his fault.<br>
Of course you can say that about anyone.<br>
But in his case he probably could never grasp 'an unknown future.' Nothing could be more terrifying than to be born that way.&quot;<br>
Shogo then continued, &quot;What I mean is that, even a dumb ass like me can think everything's pointless.<br>
Why do I get up and eat? It all ends up shit anyway.<br>
Why am I going to school and studying? Even if I happen to succeed I'm going to die anyway.<br>
You wear nice clothes, you seek respect, you make a lot of money, but what's the point? It's all pointless.<br>
Of course, this kind of meaninglessness might suit this crappy nation.<br>
But…but, you see, we still have emotions like joy and happiness, right? They may not amount to much.<br>
But they fill up our emptiness.<br>
That's the only explanation I have.<br>
So…these emotions are probably missing from Kazuo.<br>
He's got no foundation for values.<br>
So he merely chooses.<br>
He doesn't have a solid foundation.<br>
He just chooses as he goes___Like for this game he might just as well have chosen not to participate.<br>
But he decided to.<br>
That's my little theory.&quot;<br>
He said all of this at once and then concluded, &quot;Yeah, it is scary that someone could live a life like that…and that we have to take on someone like that right now.&quot;<br>
They fell silent.<br>
Shogo took one more drag from his shortened cigarette and then rubbed it out against the ground.<br>
Shuya took another sip from his cup of soup.<br>
Then he looked up at the cloudy sky over the edge of Shogo's thatched roof.<br>
&quot;I wonder if Hiroki is all right.&quot;<br>
He'd mentioned the gunfire he heard after he left the lighthouse.<br>
He was still worried about it.<br>
&quot;I'm sure he's all right,&quot; Noriko said.<br>
Shuya looked at Shogo.<br>
&quot;I wonder if we'll be able to see any smoke.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded.<br>
&quot;Don't worry.<br>
We can see smoke coming from anywhere on this island.<br>
I'll check periodically.&quot;<br>
Shuya then remembered the bird call.<br>
It led him to them.<br>
But why did Shogo have such an odd thing to begin with? He was about to ask him when Noriko said, &quot;I wonder if Hiroki met up with Kayoko Kotohiki.&quot;<br>
&quot;If he did, we'd be seeing smoke,&quot; Shogo answered.<br>
Noriko nodded and then mumbled, &quot;I wonder why he had to see Kotohiki.&quot;<br>
This came up when they were in the medical clinic.<br>
Shuya's response was the same.<br>
&quot;Beats me.&quot;<br>
&quot;They didn't seem all that close.&quot;<br>
But then Noriko said, &quot;Oh…&quot; as if she'd realized something.<br>
Shuya looked up.<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know for sure.&quot; Noriko shook her head.<br>
&quot;But maybe…&quot; She emphasized her last vowel.<br>
Shuya knit his brows.<br>
&quot;Maybe what?&quot;<br>
&quot;That would be…&quot;<br>
Shogo interrupted them.<br>
Shuya looked over at him.<br>
Shogo was tearing the seal off a new pack of cigarettes and continued, his eyes glued to the pack, &quot;…too corny…in this fucking game.&quot;<br>
&quot;But…&quot; Noriko continued, &quot;…it's Hiroki, so…&quot;<br>
Shuya looked back and forth at them, utterly perplexed.<br>
8 students remaining<br>
68<br>
Kayoko Kotohiki (Female Student No.<br>
8) was hugging her knees in the bushes.<br>
She was on the southern slope of the northern mountain, in sector E=7.<br>
Evening was approaching, but the light coming through the bushes didn't change much.<br>
It just stayed dark.<br>
In the afternoon, the area was covered with thick clouds, and just two hours ago it finally began raining.<br>
Kayoko wrapped a handkerchief around her head to shield herself from the rain.<br>
Thanks to the branches over her, the rain didn't hit her directly, but her shoulders were drenched.<br>
She was cold.<br>
And of course more importantly…she was terrified.<br>
Kayoko had first hidden on the eastern side of the northern mountain peak, in sector C=8.<br>
So of course she witnessed Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano getting killed in front of her very own eyes.<br>
She held her breath.<br>
She knew that their killer was near, but she instinctively thought she would be risking more by moving.<br>
She stayed absolutely quiet.<br>
As noon and then night passed, she managed to avoid any attacks.<br>
She moved twice in accordance to the forbidden zone announcements.<br>
The second time she moved was immediately after noon today, because the southern side of the peak, sector D=7, was going to become forbidden at 1 p.m.<br>
So the northern mountain peak was now surrounded by three forbidden zones.<br>
Her allocated area was definitely shrinking.<br>
She hadn't met anyone yet.<br>
She heard a lot of gunfire, sometimes in the distance, sometimes near.<br>
She even heard an explosion, but she just remained still and absolutely quiet.<br>
The announcement every six hours made it clear though, the number of her classmates was steadily diminishing.<br>
At noon there were supposedly fourteen remaining.<br>
And then there was more gunfire.<br>
Was it now just twelve? Or ten?<br>
Kayoko put the heavy gun (Smith &amp; Wesson M59 Automatic, manual included, but Kayoko of course could care less about the gun's name) down by her feet and massaged her right-hand fingers with her left hand.<br>
She'd been holding the gun all this time, and now the muscles in her fingers had gone numb.<br>
The palm of her hand was flushed red and imprinted with the gun-grip pattern.<br>
She was completely exhausted, both from sleep deprivation and the threat of attack.<br>
Because she was too scared to enter a house that might be occupied, the only food she ate was the bread and water that came supplied with her day pack.<br>
She was hungry and thirsty.<br>
Her water intake was grossly inadequate.<br>
She did her best to save the supplied water and only drank over a liter since the game began.<br>
If there was one good thing about the rain, it was that she could collect water by putting the recently emptied water bottle under a dripping branch, but it wasn't even a third full.<br>
She would intermittently remove the handkerchief from her head and wet her dry lips with it, but of course this did nothing to relieve her dehydration.<br>
Kayoko let out a long, weary breath, combed back her short, shoulder-length hair, and took up the M59<br>
again.<br>
She was in a daze.<br>
As she sat, dazed, she thought of that face again.<br>
She kept on thinking of that face ever since the game began.<br>
He wasn't as familiar as her parents and older sister, whom she thought of as well, but he was very important to her.<br>
She just began learning tea ceremony when she first saw &quot;him&quot; at an event conducted by the school where she attended tea ceremony class.<br>
It was the fall of her first year in junior high.<br>
Sponsored by a government park for an autumn holiday, the tea ceremony was held outdoors for tourists.<br>
The actual practitioners performing that day were all adults, so Kayoko and other students her age took care of menial tasks, like arranging outdoor seating and preparing biscuits.<br>
&quot;He&quot; was one of the masters of the tea ceremony.<br>
He arrived around noon, much later that day.<br>
He was good looking, but he still looked boyish, as if he were still a college student.<br>
Kayoko thought, oh, this guy must be helping out too.<br>
But he addressed Kayoko's teacher (a 42-year-old woman) at her seat, &quot;I'm sorry I'm late,&quot; took her place, and prepared the tea.<br>
His preparation was very impressive.<br>
He handled the tea whisk and bowl incredibly gracefully, and his posture was impeccable.<br>
Despite his age, he didn't look odd in traditional clothes.<br>
Kayoko put her tasks on hold and was gazing at him when someone tapped her on the shoulder.<br>
She turned around and saw her senior in the Tea Ceremony Club at Shiroiwa Junior High, the one who'd invited her to attend the tea ceremony school.<br>
&quot;He's pretty hot, huh? He's the grandson of the headmaster.<br>
Well, to be more accurate, he's the master's mistress' grandson.<br>
I'm a fan too.<br>
I mean, basically I've been going to tea ceremony class just to meet him.&quot;<br>
The senior informed her how he was nineteen years old, and how after graduating from high school he was already ranked as an &quot;instructor&quot; with many disciples.<br>
Kayoko's only reaction at the time was, Oh, he's from another world, so there're people like him.<br>
That was all but then…<br>
She began spending more hours in front of the mirror whenever there was a tea ceremony school event, or whenever she knew he would be appearing as a guest in her class.<br>
Given her age she didn't use makeup, but she did wear her traditional kimono immaculately, kept a comb in her hair, and carefully inserted her favorite dark-blue hair clip.<br>
Her flowing brows, and although not very large, curved eyes, and although short, well-shaped nose, wide lips, nicely shaped at the center, she thought, sure, I might not be stunning, but I do look pretty mature....<br>
The reason she fell head over heels for this man adored by adolescent girls to middle-aged women alike may have been pretty simple.<br>
After all, he was handsome and intelligent, cheerful and considerate, basically the kind of ideal man you hardly believed existed.<br>
On top of that, he apparently didn't even have a girlfriend.<br>
Kayoko had two important encounters with this man (although from someone else's perspective they might not have seemed all that special).<br>
The first one occurred at the tea school's demonstration ceremony the spring she became a second-year junior high school student.<br>
The ceremony was held at the headmaster's home in Shido-cho near Shiroiwa-cho.<br>
Almost immediately after the event began, there was a problem.<br>
A special guest, the central government's regional cultural representative, suddenly began complaining about the tea ceremony.<br>
It wasn't the first time.<br>
They were government officials who announced their &quot;absolute loyalty to preserve the nation's absolute sanctity,&quot; but many of them in fact abused their power.<br>
Some would even request kickbacks in return for arranging increased national traditional arts funding which the headmaster would politely refuse, so this could have been a way to get back at them by stirring up trouble.<br>
The problem was that the headmaster was absent because he was hospitalized.<br>
The heir who substituted for the headmaster and his heir were both so completely intimidated their incompetence could have led to the school being shut down.<br>
But the nineteen-year-old master saved the day.<br>
He took the belligerent official to another room, then returned alone and said, &quot;The official has left.<br>
He seems satisfied now, so there's no need to worry, everyone.&quot;<br>
He said no more, and the attending established members of the school also refrained from inquiring any further.<br>
As a result the rest of the ceremony proceeded smoothly.<br>
But Kayoko was concerned.<br>
Knowing him, he could very well have assumed full responsibility, saying something like, &quot;I am in charge of today's ceremony,&quot; and if that were true then the official could get back at him by concocting a report and arranging his arrest for being a malign influence against the government (and as a result sending him to one of those &quot;reeducation camps&quot;).<br>
After the ceremony came to an end with no further interruptions, they began to clean up the area, and she waited for him to be alone.<br>
When he went to move the seat cushions, she decided to call on him.<br>
Sir…<br>
He stopped, still holding the cushions, and elegantly turned around towards Kayoko.<br>
His sad eyes made Kayoko's heart race, but she managed to continue, &quot;Is everything all right, sir?&quot;<br>
He seemed to understand what she was getting at and broke into a smile.<br>
Then he said, &quot;I appreciate your concern.<br>
It's all right though.&quot; Her concern was suddenly eclipsed by the thrill she felt in having her first real conversation with him.<br>
Then she asked, &quot;But…but that government official looked so mean, what if?…&quot;<br>
But he stopped Kayoko and said something sophisticated, as if admonishing her.<br>
&quot;That official doesn't necessarily get a kick out of doing what he does.<br>
I'm sure this kind of thing happens all over the world…but the way this country is…it twists people…We're supposed to strive for harmony and that's what the art of tea is supposed to accomplish… but it is very, very difficult to achieve in this country.&quot;<br>
Near the end, he almost seemed to be addressing himself.<br>
Then he looked back at Kayoko and continued, &quot;Tea ceremony is powerless.<br>
But it's also not such a bad thing either.<br>
You should enjoy it while you can.&quot; He smiled kindly, turned, and proceeded to walk away.<br>
Kayoko was in a daze and stood still for a while.<br>
The unpretentious way he talked made her feel at ease…and even though she didn't completely understand what he was saying, it impressed her, and she thought, wow, he's so mature.<br>
In any case, she might have made an impression on him because ever since that encounter he would always give her a warm smile whenever they met.<br>
The crucial encounter occurred during the winter of her second year.<br>
Kayoko came out into the old temple garden of another tea ceremony and gazed at the camellia flowers there.<br>
(In fact, she was thinking about him again.) Suddenly she heard suddenly someone from behind say, &quot;They're beautiful,&quot; in a transparent voice now familiar to her.<br>
At first she thought she'd imagined it, but when she turned around she couldn't believe he was there…smiling at her.<br>
It was the first time he addressed her without any reference to teaching tea ceremony or official duties.<br>
And so they had a conversation.<br>
&quot;So you find tea ceremony interesting?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I love it.<br>
But I'm not very good.&quot;<br>
&quot;Really? I've been impressed with your excellent posture during your preparation.<br>
It's not just that your back is upright.<br>
There's a kind of intensity.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, no, I'm really no good at all....&quot;<br>
With his hands tucked inside his sleeves, he still wore his kind smile and glanced up at the camellia.<br>
&quot;No, I really do mean it.<br>
Yes…just like those flowers.<br>
There's something strained…but there's beauty in that.<br>
Something like that.&quot;<br>
Of course, she was still just a child, and he might have only been complimenting a hobbyist dabbling in the school's tea ceremony.<br>
But that didn't stop her from getting excited.<br>
Right on! (She snapped her fingers only later in the bathroom.)<br>
From that point on Kayoko began to practice tea ceremony more seriously.<br>
She thought, I can do it.<br>
Of course, I'm still just a kid, but once I'm eighteen he'll be twenty-four.<br>
That would totally work....<br>
And so that was her memory of him.<br>
Kayoko buried her face into her skirt.<br>
A warm liquid which wasn't rain oozed into the area covering her kneecaps.<br>
Kayoko realized she was crying.<br>
Her hand holding the gun trembled.<br>
How could all this be happening?<br>
She wanted so badly to see him now.<br>
Sure, she was still a kid.<br>
But in her own adolescent way, she really did love him.<br>
This was the first time she ever had serious feelings for someone.<br>
She wanted a single moment with him so she could tell him this much.<br>
She wanted to tell this person— kind enough to describe her as &quot;beautiful&quot; even if it was only referring to her tea ceremony skills—&quot;I'm still a kid, so I may not understand what it really means to be in love.<br>
But I think I am in love with you.<br>
I really love you.&quot;<br>
Something like that.<br>
Something rustled in the bushes.<br>
Kayoko looked up.<br>
She wiped her eyes with her left hand and got up.<br>
Her feet moved automatically and took a step back from the source of the sound.<br>
A boy in a school coat—Hiroki Sugimura (Male Student No.<br>
11).<br>
His face and torso emerged from the bushes.<br>
The sleeves of his coat and shirt were torn off, revealing his right arm.<br>
The white cloth wrapped around his shoulder was stained with blood and—perhaps it was because of the rain—it oozed pink.<br>
And his hand was holding…a gun.<br>
Hiroki's jaw dropped, but what really caught her attention when she saw his grimy face were his eyes.<br>
They were gleaming.<br>
Kayoko felt a sudden surge of fear.<br>
How could she have not noticed sooner before he got this close, how—<br>
&quot;Kotohiki—&quot;<br>
Kayoko let out a shriek and turned on her heels.<br>
She entered the bushes.<br>
She didn't care about the branches scraping against her face and hair, or getting drenched in the rain.<br>
She just wanted to escape.<br>
If I don't… I'll get killed!<br>
She made her way through the bushes.<br>
There was a twisting path approximately two meters wide.<br>
Kayoko instinctively decided to run down there.<br>
If she ran uphill, he would catch up, but if she ran down then maybe…<br>
She heard a rustling sound behind her.<br>
&quot;Kotohiki!&quot; It was Hiroki's voice.<br>
He's coming after me!<br>
Kayoko summoned all her strength from her tired body and ran as fast as she could.<br>
I can't believe this, I should have been jogging instead of learning tea ceremony if I'd known this was going to happen.<br>
&quot;Kotohiki! Stop! Kotohiki!&quot;<br>
If she had been calmer—that is, if this were a scene in a movie and she were in the theater watching the actor performing as she munched on some popcorn—then it would have been obvious he was pleading with her.<br>
But right now it sounded like he was saying: &quot;Kotohiki! You better stop! I'm gonna kill you!&quot;<br>
She wasn't going to stop.<br>
The path forked.<br>
She took the left one.<br>
The area opened up on her left.<br>
Rows of tangerine trees spread out in the dull light coming through the silky rain.<br>
Beyond them was a thicket of short trees.<br>
If she could enter that area—<br>
It's impossible, she thought.<br>
She had at least fifty more meters to get there.<br>
It was hopeless.<br>
While she struggled through the uneven rows of tangerine trees, Hiroki Sugimura would catch up to her and shoot her from behind with his gun.<br>
Kayoko clenched her teeth.<br>
She didn't want to, but she had to.<br>
After all, he was trying to kill her.<br>
She stopped on her right foot and spun around to her left.<br>
By the time she had turned around the gun was in her hands.<br>
That thing called the safety had been released ever since she'd read the manual.<br>
The manual said you didn't have to raise the hammer, all you had to do was pull the trigger.<br>
The rest was…up to her.<br>
Less than ten meters away, Hiroki Sugimura stood still on the slope, his eyes wide open.<br>
It's too late.<br>
You think I won't shoot?<br>
Kayoko extended her arms and squeezed the trigger.<br>
With a pop, a small flame exploded from the muzzle, and her arms jerked back from the recoil.<br>
Hiroki's large frame spun around as if he were hit.<br>
He fell back.<br>
Kayoko ran over to him.<br>
She had to finish him off, finish him off! So he wouldn't get back up again!<br>
Kayoko stopped approximately two meters away from him.<br>
There was a small hole in the left side of his chest (she'd actually aimed at his stomach), and the fabric around it had turned dark black.<br>
But his sprawled right hand still held his gun.<br>
He still might raise it.<br>
The head.<br>
I have to aim for his head.<br>
Hiroki turned his head around and looked at Kayoko.<br>
Kayoko pointed the gun and pulled the trig—<br>
She stopped…because Hiroki had tossed his gun aside.<br>
If he'd had that kind of strength he could have pulled the trigger.<br>
What was going on?<br>
The gun spun around once and landed on its side.<br>
Huh?<br>
Kayoko stood still, holding the gun, her short hair drenched in the rain.<br>
&quot;Now listen.&quot; He lay on the messy path ridden now with puddles as he said painfully, somehow fixing his eyes on Kayoko, &quot;You have to burn some fresh wood.<br>
Build…two fires.<br>
I have a lighter in my pocket.<br>
Use that…then you'll hear a bird call.&quot;<br>
Kayoko heard him, but she had no idea what he was talking about.<br>
She had no idea what was going on.<br>
Hiroki continued.<br>
&quot;Follow that bird call.<br>
Then you'll find Shuya Nanahara…Noriko Nakagawa, and Shogo Kawada.<br>
They'll help you.<br>
You got that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Wh-what?&quot;<br>
Hiroki seemed to be smiling.<br>
He repeated patiently,<br>
&quot;Build two fires.<br>
Then find the bird call.&quot;<br>
He awkwardly moved his right arm, pulled out a small lighter from his school coat pocket, and tossed it over to Kayoko.<br>
Then he painfully closed his eyes.<br>
&quot;Okay, now go.&quot;<br>
&quot;Whaaaat?&quot;<br>
Hiroki suddenly opened his eyes wide and yelled, &quot;Go now! Someone might have heard the shot.<br>
Go!&quot;<br>
Then as if fitting the pieces of a complex jigsaw puzzle into place, Kayoko finally managed to get it.<br>
This time she got it right.<br>
&quot;Oh…oh…&quot;<br>
She dropped the gun and fell on her knees beside him.<br>
She scraped her knees but she didn't care.<br>
&quot;Hiroki! Hiroki! I…I can't believe…I can't believe I did this to you!…&quot;<br>
She burst into tears.<br>
Sure, there was something intimidating about Hiroki Sugimura.<br>
He seemed tough since he studied martial arts, plus he didn't talk much, and when he did he was always gruff.<br>
When he spoke to other boys, like Shinji Mimura and Shuya Nanahara, he would smile but otherwise he looked grumpy.<br>
She also heard he was going out with Takako Chigusa, and they looked so close.<br>
Kayoko only thought, I don't get Takako's taste, I wonder maybe if you're that pretty, you're attracted to someone intimidating.<br>
In any case…that was her impression of him.<br>
So in this situation where her classmates were being killed off one by one she was absolutely terrified of Hiroki Sugimura.<br>
But then…it turned out…<br>
He closed his eyes again and said, &quot;It's all right.&quot; He was smiling.<br>
He looked content.<br>
&quot;I was going to die soon anyway.&quot;<br>
Kayoko then finally noticed he had another wound on his side, soaked in liquid that wasn't rain.<br>
&quot;So…go now.<br>
Please.&quot;<br>
Kayoko sobbed convulsively and touched his neck gently.<br>
&quot;Let's go together.<br>
Okay? Stand.&quot;<br>
Hiroki opened his eyes and looked at her.<br>
He seemed to be smiling.<br>
&quot;Forget about me,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;I'm just glad I got to see you.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Kayoko opened her tear-stained eyes wide.<br>
What? What did you just say? &quot;What…what do you mean…&quot; Her voice was trembling.<br>
Hiroki exhaled deeply, as if to bear the pain, or maybe it was a long sigh.<br>
&quot;If I tell you, will you go?&quot;<br>
&quot;What? I don't get it.<br>
What do you mean?&quot;<br>
Hiroki said without hesitating, &quot;I love you, Kotohiki.<br>
I've loved you for a real long time.&quot;<br>
Kayoko once again didn't understand Hiroki.<br>
What's he talking about?<br>
Hiroki continued.<br>
He was looking up at the sky raining down on them.<br>
&quot;That's all I wanted to tell you.<br>
Now…go.&quot;<br>
Kayoko then uttered, &quot;But I thought…you and Takako…&quot;<br>
Hiroki looked into her eyes again.<br>
He said, &quot;You're the one.&quot;<br>
She finally got it.<br>
She was blown away as if struck by a huge wrecking ball swinging from a demolition crane.<br>
Love, me? You wanted to tell me…don't tell me you were trying to find me? Is that true? If so…then what did I just do?<br>
Her breath was raspy.<br>
She kept on getting choked up, but finally she managed to cry out,<br>
&quot;Hiroki…Hiroki!&quot;<br>
&quot;Hurry,&quot; Hiroki said and coughed out a mist of blood, spraying Kayoko's face.<br>
Hiroki opened his eyes again.<br>
&quot;Hiroki…I…I…I…&quot;<br>
Her body was supposedly dehydrated from lack of water, but the tears kept on gushing out.<br>
&quot;It's all right,&quot; Hiroki said kindly.<br>
He closed his eyes slowly.<br>
&quot;Kayoko…&quot; he called her by her first name as if it were a precious treasure.<br>
It was probably the first time he had ever called her by her first name.<br>
&quot;I don't mind at all..<br>
-dying because of you.<br>
So please, please go.<br>
Or else…&quot;<br>
Kayoko kept on crying, waiting for Hiroki to continue.<br>
&quot;Or else&quot;?<br>
Hiroki didn't say anything.<br>
Kayoko slowly reached out for him.<br>
She held his shoulders and shook them.<br>
&quot;Hiroki! Hiroki!&quot;<br>
In a TV drama when someone died their words would be cut off, like, &quot;Or el—&quot; but Hiroki managed to say in a painful but clear voice, &quot;Or else.&quot; So there had to be more.<br>
Or else?…<br>
&quot;Hiroki! Hey, Hiroki!&quot;<br>
Kayoko shook his body one more time.<br>
Then she finally realized he was dead.<br>
Once she realized this, the dam restraining her torrent of emotions suddenly collapsed.<br>
A shriek was welling up inside.<br>
&quot;AHHH!&quot; On her knees, Kayoko fell over Hiroki's body and cried.<br>
He loved me…he loved me so much he sought me out at the risk of being attacked.<br>
Any encounter could have led to an attack on him.<br>
In fact, the wound in his side…the wound on his shoulder… came as a result of him trying to find me.<br>
No…there's more.<br>
Kayoko stopped sobbing for a moment.<br>
I was the one who attacked Hiroki.<br>
At the very end, when Hiroki managed to achieve his goal.<br>
Kayoko shut her eyes and cried again.<br>
He loved me…just like I wanted to tell &quot;that guy&quot; how I felt about him, Hiroki was thinking the same thing about me, looking for me.<br>
Someone in my class cared for me that much.<br>
And yet…and yet___<br>
Suddenly, Kayoko recalled a scene.<br>
It was when they were doing their cleaning tasks.<br>
Kayoko was wiping the blackboard with a wet rag and when she couldn't reach the top, Hiroki, who had been slacking off, rested his chin against his hands that were holding the upright broom as if it were a cane, and said, &quot;You're too short, Kotohiki.&quot; He took the rag from her and wiped the area she couldn't reach.<br>
The scene came back to her.<br>
Why…why didn't I see how kind he was? How could I not notice how someone loved me so much? If I'd thought about it, I would have realized if Hiroki wanted to kill me he could have immediately shot me with his gun.<br>
But I couldn't tell.<br>
I wasn't able to understand.<br>
I am so stupid.<br>
I—<br>
Another memory came flashing by.<br>
When she was telling some of her classmate friends about &quot;that guy,&quot; Hiroki, who was nearby looking out the window, muttered, &quot;You're being foolish, getting so worked up like that.&quot; It made her mad at the time, but in fact he was right, she was being foolish.<br>
And yet…and yet Hiroki told her he'd cherished this fool.<br>
She simply couldn't stop crying.<br>
She pressed her cheek against his warm cheek and continued to sob.<br>
Hiroki told her to go, but she couldn't bring herself to do that.<br>
I'm going to keep on crying, I'm going to cry over the dedication (it was irreplaceable) of this boy who loved me and my foolishness (I was such a kid thinking I was actually in the running for &quot;that guy&quot;), I'm going to keep on crying.<br>
Even if it was suicidal in this game.<br>
You plan on dying with him? A voice whispered to her in her thoughts.<br>
That's right, yes, I'm going to die with him.<br>
I'm going to die for the sake of Hiroki's love for me and my foolishness.<br>
&quot;Then why…don't you go ahead?&quot; the voice said.<br>
Kayoko suddenly trembled and turned around.<br>
She saw the long, beautiful, rain-drenched hair of Mitsuko Souma (Female Student No.<br>
11), gazing down at her, gun in hand.<br>
BAM BAM, two dry pops formed two holes in Kayoko's right temple.<br>
Kayoko's body then landed on Hiroki Sugimura's body.<br>
Blood slowly began flowing out of the holes in her head.<br>
The blood continued flowing down her face against the rain washing it away.<br>
Mitsuko lowered the Smith &amp; Wesson M19 .357 Magnum and said, &quot;You really were a fool.<br>
You should have understood him.&quot;<br>
Then she looked over at Hiroki's face.<br>
&quot;Long time no see, Hiroki.<br>
Are you glad you got to die with your beloved?&quot;<br>
She shook her head, disgusted, and proceeded to walk forward to pick up the Smith &amp; Wesson M59<br>
Kayoko dropped and the Colt Government .45 (which had been Mitsuko's) Hiroki had tossed aside.<br>
She looked down at the intertwined bodies and put her finger against her lips.<br>
&quot;Now what was that about…building a fire?&quot;<br>
Then she shook her head.<br>
With her foot she brushed away Kayoko's skirt covering part of the M59 and reached for the blue gun, when she suddenly heard the rattling sound of an old typewriter.<br>
6 students remaining<br>
69<br>
Her back was pummeled, repeatedly.<br>
Her chest burst open with blood.<br>
She staggered…and she felt something hot expand inside her, like burning embers.<br>
She didn't feel so much the painful shock as she felt dismayed.<br>
How could she not have heard someone sneaking up behind her in this mud?<br>
The bullets had done enough damage, but Mitsuko managed to turn around.<br>
There was a boy in a school coat.<br>
The unique slicked-back hair, the well-defined face, the gleaming, frigid eyes.<br>
It was Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No.<br>
6).<br>
Mitsuko squeezed her right hand holding the Ml9.<br>
Her muscles were nearly disabled, but she summoned all her remaining strength and attempted to raise the gun.<br>
Suddenly Mitsuko's thoughts—despite the fact that she was in a life-or-death confrontation—slipped into another dimension.<br>
It only lasted for a split second.<br>
When I spoke to Hiroki Sugimura I said:<br>
&quot;I just decided to take instead of being taken.&quot;<br>
That's what I said.<br>
When did I…become like that? Was it after the time I told Hiroki about, when I was raped by three men? That day I was raped by those men with the video camera in a rundown apartment room in the shabby outskirts of town? Or maybe the moment my drunken mother (I never had a father) left the room when she received the thick envelope (it couldn't have been that thick) after taking me to that room before &quot;it&quot; happened? From then on? Or…was it after my elementary school teacher, the one person I thought I could trust, kindly addressed me, nearly numb from trauma, and I finally told him exactly what happened, when the look on his face changed, and it happened again? From that point on? In that small, dark reading room after school? Or after my best friend saw it (at least part of it) and instead of offering consolation, spread a rumor (which led to the teacher leaving the school)? Or was it three months later when I resisted my mother, who was trying to take me to do &quot;it&quot; again and accidentally ended up killing her? After getting rid of all the evidence and doing everything to make it look like a break-in, I sat on a swing in the park.<br>
From that point on? Or after being taken in by distant relatives, I was repeatedly harassed by their kid, and when the kid accidentally fell from the roof, the mother accused me of killing her since I was with her? From that point on? The father intervened and defended me, but then after a while, this father started fooling around with me.<br>
From that point on? Or…<br>
Little by little, no, more like in big chunks, everyone took from Mitsuko.<br>
No one gave Mitsuko anything.<br>
And so Mitsuko ended up an empty shell.<br>
But…<br>
… that didn't matter.<br>
I am right.<br>
I will not lose.<br>
Her arms were suddenly strengthened, and she lifted the gun.<br>
The tendons in her wrist rose up, resembling violin strings.<br>
Then she pulled the—<br>
The rattling Ingram M10 in Kazuo Kiriyama's hands fired away a row of four holes that ran from her chest up to the middle of her head.<br>
Blood sprayed out of Mitsuko's mouth.<br>
Her upper lip tore.<br>
She bent backwards.<br>
Still Mitsuko managed to smile.<br>
She regained her footing and pulled the trigger.<br>
Over and over.<br>
The four bullets from the chamber struck Kazuo Kiriyama's chest.<br>
But…Kazuo remained calm as he staggered only slightly.<br>
Mitsuko didn't understand why.<br>
Kazuo's Ingram then fired away again.<br>
Mitsuko's face, once so beautiful, was torn up as if a strawberry pie had been flung into her face.<br>
This time her body was blown back—and the next moment she fell back onto the wet ground.<br>
By then she was dead.<br>
In fact, she may have been dead a while ago.<br>
Physically, several seconds ago, mentally, ages ago.<br>
Kazuo Kiriyama walked up to her slowly, and then calmly removed the gun from her hand.<br>
He also picked up the Colt Government .45 lying by Hiroki Sugimura's hand and the M59 Kayoko Kotohiki had tossed aside.<br>
He didn't even bother glancing at the three rain-drenched bodies.<br>
5 students remaining<br>
70<br>
Mizuho Inada (Female Student No.</p>
<ol>
<li>cautiously looked out from the shade of the bushes.<br>
Due to the relentless rain her neatly cropped hair stuck to her forehead.<br>
Beyond the bushes there was a narrow farm field, and through the light sheet of rain she saw the back side of a school coat in the middle of the field.<br>
His slicked-back hair was also wet from the rain.<br>
It was Kazuo Kiriyama (Male Student No.<br>
6).<br>
Kazuo Kiriyama had formed what appeared to be two piles of branches.<br>
Now he sat arranging one of the piles.<br>
Mizuho calmed her breathing.<br>
It was cold, and she was tired, but she didn't really mind.<br>
After all, she was about to execute her most important mission…<br>
…as a space warrior.<br>
Are you ready, warrior Prexia Dikianne Mizuho?<br>
In her mind, the God of Light Ahura Mazda asked her this.<br>
Apparently, this voice came from the spindle-shaped magic crystal (in fact the mail order item was made of glass but Mizuho believed it was crystal) she wore.<br>
Of course.<br>
Mizuho responded.<br>
I saw that demon walk away after killing Yumiko Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano.<br>
I lost track of him, but just found him.<br>
And I saw him kill that other demon who killed Kayoko Kotohiki.<br>
I must defeat this enemy.<br>
And I have followed him this far.<br>
Very well then.<br>
So you understand your mission?<br>
Of course, sir.<br>
I received your message from the local fortune teller, that I would become a warrior destined to fight evil.<br>
I didn't understand what it meant at the time.<br>
But now, now I understand completely.<br>
Very well then.<br>
Are you not scared?<br>
No, sir.<br>
With your guidance I have nothing to fear.<br>
Very well then.<br>
You are a surviving member of the Holy Dikianne Tribe.<br>
You are a chosen warrior.<br>
The light of victory will shine upon you soon.<br>
Hm? What is it?<br>
No, no.<br>
It's just that, great Ahura Mazda, my fellow warrior, Lorela Lausasse Kaori was killed (in their former Class B classroom, Kaori Minami, who spent some time hanging out with Mizuho Inada, would restrain herself from yawning every time Mizuho told her, &quot;You're the warrior Lorela,&quot; but whatever).<br>
She…<br>
She fought to the very end, Mizuho.<br>
Ah.<br>
Oh, I thought so.<br>
But, but, she was defeated by the evil forces.<br>
Uh, well, yes.<br>
Well, that was because she was a mere commoner in origins.<br>
You are different.<br>
In any case, let's not fuss over the details.<br>
The important thing is that you must fight for her sake.<br>
And you must win.<br>
All right?<br>
Yes, sir.<br>
Okay then.<br>
The light.<br>
You must have faith in the cosmic light.<br>
The light that engulfs you.<br>
The light grew inside her.<br>
The great warm cosmic power that encompassed everything.<br>
Mizuho nodded again in her brief repose.<br>
Yes.<br>
Yes.<br>
Yes.<br>
Then she pulled the double-bladed knife (when she found the weapon in her day pack she thought it most becoming for a warrior) out of its sheath.<br>
She held it up in front of her face.<br>
A white light covered the blue blade, and Mizuho looked at Kazuo beyond the light.<br>
She saw Kazuo's back.<br>
It was wide open.<br>
Now then.<br>
You must cut down the enemy!<br>
Yes!<br>
In order to keep quiet, Mizuho dodged the bushes and dashed towards Kazuo.<br>
A light burst out from the short blade that had been barely fifteen centimeters in length, and it suddenly transformed into a legendary sword at least one meter long.<br>
This sword of light would pierce the evil monster with a single thrust.<br>
As Kazuo Kiriyama adjusted the branches with his left hand, his right hand calmly pulled out the Beretta M92F.<br>
Without even turning around, he reached around and pulled the trigger twice.<br>
The first shot hit Mizuho in the chest, stopping her, and the second shot went right through her head.<br>
Mizuho fell back as her wounds burst into gently curved red lines drawn through the air.<br>
The rain immediately began washing away the blood.<br>
Then the warrior Prexia Dikianne Mizuho's soul transmigrated to the Land of Light.<br>
His back still facing her, Kazuo Kiriyama put away his gun and continued arranging the branches.<br>
4 students remaining<br>
71<br>
It continued to rain.<br>
Shuya was slouched against the wet rock wall as he watched the rain dripping off the edge of the thatched roof.<br>
He heard rapid gunfire.<br>
Then about five minutes ago he heard gunfire again, this time two single shots.<br>
Both times it didn't sound too close, but it didn't seem too far away either.<br>
It was probably somewhere in the northern mountain, where they were camping.<br>
A large raindrop slid along one of the &quot;roof&quot; leaves and fell by Shuya's stretched out foot wearing Keds sneakers, splashing against the muddy water.<br>
&quot;Maybe Hiroki likes Kotohiki.&quot;<br>
That's what Noriko had said.<br>
&quot;If I were him…I would have done the same thing.&quot; She glanced at Shuya.<br>
&quot;I would find the person I cared about.&quot;<br>
Was it true? Did Hiroki like Kayoko Kotohiki? Why, when he was so close to the prettiest girl in their class, would he be into a Plain Jane like Kayoko?<br>
Well, maybe that's how it was.<br>
After all, Billy Joel sang, &quot;Don't imagine you're too familiar…I'll take you just the way you are.&quot;<br>
Then…who was involved (the second series of shots sounded like it was just one assailant shooting away) in those rounds of gunshots he just heard? If he were to include the gunfire he heard immediately after leaving the lighthouse, it meant he'd heard guns go off three times since noon.<br>
(This wasn't including what happened to Yukie Utsumi's group.) It would be reasonable to assume at least three people had died.<br>
Then there were only five left? Which three got killed? Or maybe no one died at all, maybe there were just confrontations, and everyone managed to escape each other.<br>
Then eight students, including Shuya's group, were left.<br>
&quot;Are you tired, Shuya?&quot;<br>
They were sitting next to each other in a row, but Shogo, who was on the other side of Noriko, asked,<br>
&quot;Maybe you should sleep a little.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked back at them.<br>
&quot;No.&quot; He gave a smile.<br>
&quot;I slept a lot until noon.<br>
I bet you haven't had much sleep.&quot;<br>
Shogo shrugged.<br>
&quot;I'm fine.<br>
But Noriko.<br>
She didn't sleep at all waiting for you.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked over at Noriko, but she waved her palms at Shuya and smiled.<br>
&quot;That's not entirely true.<br>
I dozed off a little here and there.<br>
Shogo's the one who hasn't slept for my sake.&quot;<br>
Shogo chuckled and shrugged.<br>
Then he held his right hand up to his chest in a salute and said, &quot;I shall always guard you, Your Highness.&quot;<br>
Noriko grinned, touched his hand, and said, &quot;The honor is mine, Shogo.&quot;<br>
Shuya raised his brow and observed their interaction.<br>
It was odd how close Noriko and Shogo seemed now.<br>
Ever since the game began, Noriko seemed to speak to Shogo mostly through Shuya, but now things seemed different.<br>
They seemed like a good pair on their own.<br>
It was only natural though, given how they'd spent over half a day without Shuya.<br>
Shogo suddenly pointed at Shuya and said, &quot;Uh oh.<br>
Shuya's getting jealous.&quot;<br>
Noriko opened her eyes wide and looked at Shuya.<br>
She smiled and said, &quot;No...&quot;<br>
Shuya blushed a little.<br>
&quot;I am not.<br>
What are you talking about?&quot;<br>
Shogo shrugged.<br>
He raised his brow and said to Noriko in mock exasperation, &quot;He says he trusts you, out of love.&quot;<br>
Shuya wanted to say something, but he was speechless.<br>
Shogo began laughing.<br>
Clacking up, really.<br>
Despite the urge to protest, Shuya ended up going along with it and chuckled too.<br>
Noriko was smiling too.<br>
It was a brief but wonderful moment.<br>
It was the kind of conversation and laughter you'd share with your longtime friends, hanging out with them after school at your favorite cafe Of course, looming over them was the feeling that they were all here only after attending a friend's funeral....<br>
Still smiling, Shogo looked down at his watch and went outside to check again for a signal from Hiroki.<br>
Noriko grinned and looked at Shuya.<br>
&quot;Shogo likes to kid around.&quot;<br>
Shuya smiled.<br>
&quot;Yeah, but…&quot; He squinted at the open space.<br>
I might have been jealous.<br>
Shuya looked back at Noriko again.<br>
He was about to tell her in a joking way, &quot;I may have been jealous.&quot;<br>
Then Noriko would probably laugh and say, &quot;Yeah right.&quot;<br>
Shogo returned to the front of the roof.<br>
His stubbly face was moist with raindrops.<br>
&quot;I see smoke,&quot; he said and immediately turned around.<br>
Shuya quickly got up.<br>
He helped Noriko up with his uninjured right arm.<br>
They walked to where Shogo was standing.<br>
The rain was light now, so he could make out the smoke drifting in the sky.<br>
As he followed Shogo's eyes…he saw a white column of smoke on the opposite side of the northern mountain.<br>
Two columns, in fact.<br>
&quot;Right on!&quot;<br>
Without thinking, Shuya gave a little holler out as if singing a rock and roll song.<br>
His eyes met Noriko's.<br>
Noriko, no less enthusiastic, broke into a grin and said, &quot;So Hiroki's safe.&quot;<br>
Shogo took out the bird call from his pocket and teaked it as he observed the smoke.<br>
The cheerful chirping of a little bird rose and spread out into the rain covering the island.<br>
As he continued, Shogo checked his watch.<br>
Fifteen seconds later he stopped.<br>
Shogo then looked over at them.<br>
&quot;Let's wait a little more here.<br>
My guess is he won't hear this sound unless he's close.<br>
It'll take time.&quot;<br>
They returned underneath the roof.<br>
&quot;Hiroki probably found Kayoko,&quot; Noriko said.<br>
Shuya was about to nod but stopped when he saw Shogo's mouth stiffen.<br>
Noriko also stopped smiling.<br>
&quot;Shogo…&quot; Shuya said.<br>
Shogo looked up.<br>
Then he shook his head.<br>
&quot;It's nothing.<br>
I just think things might not be what they seem.&quot;<br>
&quot;Huh? But…&quot; Shuya raised his opened right palm.<br>
&quot;Hiroki would never give up though.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded.<br>
&quot;That might be true.&quot; He stopped and then looked away from them.<br>
&quot;But he might have only found Kayoko Kotohiki dead.&quot;<br>
Shuya's face became tense.<br>
He was right.<br>
Kotohiki seemed to be alive up until noon…but there was all that gunfire.<br>
They'd just heard those single shots.<br>
After searching around for two weeks, Hiroki might have ended up discovering Kayoko Kotohiki had died.<br>
Shogo continued, &quot;Or there might have been a totally different outcome.&quot;<br>
Noriko asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
Shogo took out a pack of cigarettes and answered curtly, &quot;It's very possible Kayoko didn't trust Hiroki.&quot;<br>
Shuya and Noriko both fell silent.<br>
Shogo lit his cigarette and continued, &quot;Well, in any case, let's just hope Hiroki can make it back here.<br>
We'll see then whether he's with Kayoko or not.&quot;<br>
Shuya was hoping Hiroki would return with Kayoko Kotohiki.<br>
Then… there would be five of them.<br>
Five of them could escape.<br>
Only five.<br>
Shuya then recalled that Mizuho Inada was still alive, at least she had been at noon.<br>
&quot;Shogo.&quot;<br>
Shogo glanced at Shuya.<br>
&quot;Inada is still alive.<br>
I wonder if we can't contact her.&quot;<br>
Shogo shrugged.<br>
&quot;I keep on saying this, but it's best not to trust the others too much in this game.<br>
To be honest, nothing against Hiroki, but I don't necessarily trust Kotohiki either.&quot;<br>
Shuya bit his lip.<br>
&quot;I know but—&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, if we can afford to, then I'll come up with some way to contact Mizuho, but,&quot; he blew out smoke,<br>
&quot;don't forget, we may not be around to do that.&quot;<br>
That's right, Shogo had said, &quot;At the very end.<br>
Once everyone else is dead, there's a way out.&quot; That meant no matter what, they would have to confront Kazuo again and also take on Mitsuko Souma.<br>
He wasn't sure about Mitsuko, but there would be no way around fighting Kazuo.<br>
There was no way Kazuo could die easily.<br>
Which mean that…everyone in Shuya's trio might not survive fighting him.<br>
Shogo puffed on his shortened cigarette and said, &quot;I'm going to ask you again, Shuya.&quot; He exhaled a puff of smoke and continued to stare at Shuya, &quot;Even if we manage to hook up with Hiroki, we're probably going to have to fight Kazuo again and Mitsuko___Are you prepared to be merciless?&quot;<br>
So that's what it came down to.<br>
They could afford to contact Mizuho Inada only after they'd defeated Kazuo and Mitsuko.<br>
Although he wasn't comfortable with how he'd gotten used to the idea of killing his classmates no matter how extreme the circumstances were…<br>
…Shuya nodded and responded, &quot;I am.&quot;<br>
4 students remaining<br>
72<br>
Shogo tweaked the bird call.<br>
It was the third time.<br>
The rain was now lightening up, and the drops falling off the edge of the roof became less frequent.<br>
The time was already past 5 p.m.<br>
After he heard the same bird sound four times Shuya managed to join up with Noriko and Shogo.<br>
But that was because he had some idea of their location.<br>
It could take Hiroki longer to find them since he didn't have that information.<br>
Shogo returned under the roof and lit a Wild Seven.<br>
He blew out smoke and asked out of the blue, &quot;Where do you want to go?&quot;<br>
Shuya looked at Shogo, who was sitting on the other side of Noriko.<br>
Shogo turned towards him.<br>
&quot;I forgot to mention it, but I have a connection.<br>
Once we get out of here we can stay there for the time being.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who's that?&quot; Shuya asked and Shogo nodded.<br>
&quot;A friend of my dad's,&quot; he continued.<br>
&quot;He'll see to it that you get out of this country… I'm assuming you'll want to do that.<br>
You'll get killed if you stay in this country.<br>
You'll be hunted down like rats.&quot;<br>
&quot;Escape the country…&quot; Noriko said, surprised.<br>
&quot;We can really do that?&quot;<br>
Shuya also asked, &quot;Who's this friend of your father's?&quot;<br>
Shogo looked at them, as if considering something as he held the cigarette to his mouth with his left hand.<br>
He removed the cigarette from his mouth and said, &quot;Right now isn't a good time to tell you.&quot; Then he continued, &quot;In case we end up splitting up during our escape it'd be bad if either of you get caught and share our plans with the government.<br>
It's not that I don't trust you.<br>
But once they torture you, you'll eventually end up confessing.<br>
So I'll be in charge of getting us there.&quot;<br>
Shuya thought about it and then nodded.<br>
It seemed like he was making the right call.<br>
&quot;But…let's see,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
He bit his cigarette and pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket.<br>
It looked like the sheet on which they'd all written that statement, &quot;We shall kill each other.&quot; Shogo tore it in two and then scribbled onto both pieces.<br>
He folded them up neatly and offered one to Shuya and the other to Noriko.<br>
&quot;What's this?&quot; Shuya asked and began opening it up.<br>
Shogo stopped him, saying, &quot;Hold on.<br>
Don't look at it now.<br>
It's our contact method, just in any case.<br>
The time and locations are written on it.<br>
Go to that place and time every day.<br>
I'll do my best to get there too.&quot;<br>
&quot;We can't look at it now?&quot; Noriko asked.<br>
&quot;Nope,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
&quot;Look at it only in case we end up splitting up.<br>
In other words…your note and Shuya's have different information.<br>
It's best you two don't know what's on each other's note.<br>
Just in case one of you gets caught.&quot;<br>
Shuya and Noriko looked at each other.<br>
Then Shuya turned to Shogo.<br>
&quot;I'm going to be with Noriko no matter what.&quot;<br>
&quot;I know I know,&quot; Shogo grinned wryly, &quot;but we can't rule out the possibility you might get separated again, like you were when Kazuo attacked us.&quot;<br>
Shuya pursed his lips and looked over at Shogo…but ended up nodding.<br>
He exchanged glances with Noriko and put away the memo.<br>
So did Noriko.<br>
It was true.<br>
Anything could happen.<br>
Escaping this island in the first place was going to be incredibly difficult.<br>
But if that were the case then shouldn't he and Noriko also come up with their own place and time to meet? Without telling Shogo? Then again, if Shogo ended up getting caught by the government then their situation would be hopeless anyway.<br>
Shogo asked, &quot;So…where do you want to go?&quot;<br>
Shuya recalled how Shogo wanted to know their ideal destinations once they fled the country.<br>
He folded his arms and thought about it.<br>
Then he said, &quot;It'd have to be America.<br>
It's where rock came from.<br>
I always wanted to go there, at least once.&quot; He thought, I didn't think I'd be escaping there, though.<br>
&quot;I see.&quot; Shogo nodded.<br>
&quot;What about you, Noriko?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't really have anywhere in mind but…&quot; Noriko said and glanced over at Shuya.<br>
Shuya nodded back.<br>
&quot;Let's go together.<br>
All right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh…&quot; Noriko's eyes opened wide.<br>
Then she formed a smile and nodded.<br>
&quot;Sure, if you're all right with that.&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled.<br>
He took another drag from his cigarette and asked, &quot;What will you do once you get there?&quot;<br>
Shuya thought about it.<br>
Then he answered with a grin, &quot;I'll be busking with my guitar.<br>
At least I'll make some change.&quot;<br>
Shogo chuckled, &quot;Huh.&quot; Then he said, &quot;You best be a rocker.<br>
You're talented.<br>
From what I hear, in that country the odds aren't stacked so high against you even if you're an immigrant or exile.&quot;<br>
Shuya took a deep breath and gave him a skeptical grin.<br>
&quot;I'm not that talented.<br>
I don't have what it takes to be a pro.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know about that.&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled and shook his head.<br>
Then he looked over at Noriko.<br>
&quot;What about you, Noriko? Anything you want to do?&quot;<br>
Noriko pursed her lips.<br>
Then she said, &quot;I've always wanted to be a teacher.&quot;<br>
Her reply caught Shuya by surprise since he'd never heard about it.<br>
He exclaimed, &quot;Really?&quot;<br>
Noriko turned to look at Shuya and nodded.<br>
Shuya continued, &quot;You wanted to be a teacher in this lousy country?&quot;<br>
Noriko grimaced, &quot;There are good teachers too.<br>
I…that's right,&quot; she looked down and continued, &quot;I thought Mr.<br>
Hayashida was a good teacher.&quot;<br>
It had been a while since Shuya recalled the corpse of Mr.<br>
Hayashida, whose head was half crushed.<br>
&quot;Dragonfly&quot; died for their sake.<br>
&quot;…you're right,&quot; Shuya agreed.<br>
Shogo said, &quot;It might be difficult to become a teacher as an exile.<br>
But you might be able do research at some university.<br>
Ironically enough, the rest of the world seems very interested in this country.<br>
Then you might be able to teach.&quot; He continued staring ahead, then tossed his cigarette butt into the puddle by his feet.<br>
He put another cigarette in his mouth and lit it.<br>
He continued, &quot;So you should go for it, both of you.<br>
Be what you want to be.<br>
Follow your heart and give it your best shot.&quot;<br>
Shuya thought what he said was kind of cool.<br>
Follow your heart.<br>
Do your best.<br>
The way the late Shinji Mimura would also say something sometimes that hit the mark.<br>
Then he realized something.<br>
&quot;What about you?&quot; He asked anxiously, &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;<br>
Shogo shrugged his shoulders.<br>
&quot;I told you.<br>
It's payback time against this country.<br>
No, that's not it.<br>
They owe me, and they're going to pay me back.<br>
No matter what.<br>
I can't join you guys.&quot;<br>
&quot;No…&quot; Noriko said with anguish.<br>
Shuya responded differently, though.<br>
He clenched his teeth and said, &quot;Let me join you.&quot;<br>
Shogo looked at Shuya for a moment…then he looked down and dismissively shook his head.<br>
&quot;Don't be stupid.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
Shuya said insistently.<br>
&quot;You're not the only one with a grudge against this fucking country.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right,&quot; Noriko insisted.<br>
Her response surprised Shuya.<br>
Noriko looked at Shogo and continued,<br>
&quot;We'll do it together.&quot;<br>
Shogo looked at them.<br>
He heaved a deep sigh.<br>
He looked up and said, &quot;Look.<br>
I think I told you before that this country might be fucked up, but it's well run.<br>
It's almost impossible to take it down.<br>
No, I'd say it's absolutely impossible right now, but I…&quot; He turned around and then looked beyond the roof at the sky turning white from the receding rain.<br>
Then he looked back at them.<br>
&quot;To use a cliche, I just want to take a stab at it.<br>
I'm getting back at them.<br>
I'm only doing it for my own sake, which isn't such a bad thing.&quot; He stopped and then said, &quot;No, it's not bad at all.&quot;<br>
&quot;So then—&quot; Shuya said but Shogo interrupted him, raising his hand.<br>
&quot;I'm not done.&quot;<br>
Shuya shut up and let him speak.<br>
&quot;I'm saying you'll die if you join me.<br>
You just said you're going to be with Noriko.<br>
Which means…&quot; He looked at Noriko.<br>
Then he looked back at Shuya.<br>
&quot;You still have Noriko.<br>
You protect her, Shuya.<br>
If she's in danger then fight for her.<br>
Whether your assailant's a burglar, the fucking Republic of Greater East Asia, or an extraterrestrial alien.&quot; Then he turned to Noriko and said kindly, &quot;You too.<br>
You still have Shuya, right? Protect him, Noriko.<br>
It's foolish to die pointlessly.&quot; Then he looked at Shuya again.<br>
&quot;You understand? There's nothing left for me.<br>
So I'm just doing it for my sake.<br>
It's different for you guys.&quot; The last statement sounded adamant.<br>
He checked his watch, tossed another cigarette into the puddle, got up and went out from under the roof.<br>
The chirping bird call rang out.<br>
As he listened Shuya recalled a song by a mainland Chinese rocker that went: &quot;Perhaps you are saying/You love me even though I have nothing at all.&quot;<br>
But what did Shogo mean when he said he had nothing?—<br>
After tweaking the bird call for exactly fifteen seconds, Shogo went back underneath the roof and sat down.<br>
Noriko asked Shogo, gently, &quot;Don't you have someone you care about?&quot;<br>
That's right.<br>
That's what he wanted to ask too.<br>
Shogo opened his eyes and then forced a grin.<br>
&quot;I wasn't planning on telling you, but…&quot; he said and then took a deep breath.<br>
He continued, &quot;No, maybe I did want to tell you.&quot; He reached behind for his back pocket and pulled out his wallet.<br>
He removed a photo with frayed edges.<br>
Noriko took it.<br>
She and Shuya looked at it.<br>
The photo included Shogo.<br>
He was wearing a school coat, and his hair was as long as Shuya's.<br>
He was smiling, wearing a bashful smile that was hard to imagine on him now.<br>
And on his left was a girl in a sailor suit uniform.<br>
Her black hair was bundled over her right shoulder.<br>
She looked assertive, but her smile was incredibly charming too.<br>
In the background were a road, gingko-like trees, a whiskey billboard ad, and a yellow car.<br>
&quot;She's beautiful…&quot; Noriko exclaimed.<br>
Shogo rubbed the tip of his nose.<br>
&quot;Really? She's not what you'd call typically beautiful, but I always thought she was pretty.&quot;<br>
Noriko shook her head.<br>
&quot;Well, I think she's very pretty and very…mature looking.<br>
Is she the same age as you?&quot;<br>
Shogo broke into a bashful grin that was reminiscent of the one he wore in the photo.<br>
&quot;Yeah.<br>
Thanks.&quot;<br>
Shuya gazed at the two smiling faces next to each other in the photo and thought, hey, what do you mean you have nothing? But Shuya had overlooked something crucial.<br>
&quot;So is she in Kobe?&quot; Shuya asked and then Shogo grimaced.<br>
He shook his head and said, &quot;Remember, Shuya? I played this fucking game once before.<br>
And I was the 'winner.'&quot;<br>
That was when Shuya realized.<br>
And Noriko probably did too.<br>
Her face stiffened.<br>
Shogo continued, &quot;She was in my class.<br>
I wasn't able to save Keiko.&quot;<br>
They fell silent.<br>
Shuya finally felt he could truly understand Shogo's anger, the sheer depth of it.<br>
&quot;So you see now,&quot; Shogo said, &quot;I really have nothing.<br>
And it's payback time against this country for killing Keiko.&quot; Shogo put another cigarette in his mouth and lit it.<br>
Smoke drifted by.<br>
&quot;So her name was Keiko,&quot; Shuya finally asked.<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Shogo gave several small nods.&quot;'Kei' means 'joy.' &quot;<br>
Shuya realized it was same kanji character as the first character to Yoshitoki's name.<br>
&quot;Were you…&quot; Noriko gently asked, &quot;…with her until the very end?&quot;<br>
Shogo smoked silently.<br>
After a while he replied, &quot;That's a hard one to answer.&quot; He continued, &quot;Her last name was Onuki.<br>
The roll call started with No.<br>
17 in that game.<br>
Whatever.<br>
Anyway, Keiko's number came before mine, so she left three numbers before me.&quot;<br>
Shuya and Noriko listened quietly.<br>
&quot;I thought…she might be waiting for me somewhere near the departure point.<br>
She just might be.<br>
But she wasn't there.<br>
I mean it couldn't be helped.<br>
Just like with this current game.<br>
It was dangerous to hang around the departure point.&quot; He took a drag from his cigarette and exhaled.<br>
&quot;But I finally found her.<br>
The game took place on an island like this one, but I found her.&quot; He took another drag and exhaled.<br>
Then he continued, &quot;But she ran away.&quot;<br>
Shuya was shocked.<br>
He looked at Shogo.<br>
His stubbly face remained calm.<br>
It seemed like he was doing his best to restrain his emotions.<br>
&quot;I tried chasing her…but I was attacked by someone else.<br>
I managed to kill that person…but I ended up losing sight of her.&quot;<br>
He took another drag and then exhaled.<br>
&quot;Keiko couldn't trust me.&quot;<br>
He still wore his poker face, but there was a tense look in his eyes.<br>
He continued, &quot;But I still looked for her.<br>
The next time I found her…she was dead.&quot;<br>
Shuya understood.<br>
Once he was back here Shuya had told them about Yukie Utsumi's group and observed, &quot;It's so hard to…trust someone,&quot; to which Shogo responded by saying, &quot;Yes, it is…It's very…hard.&quot; Shuya now saw why Shogo looked so uneasy then.<br>
He also understood why Shogo said Hiroki might have found Kotohiki dead, or that she might not necessarily trust him.<br>
&quot;You asked me, Shuya,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
Shuya looked up.<br>
&quot;Why I trusted you guys, when we first met, right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;I did.&quot;<br>
&quot;And I believe I said you two made a nice couple,&quot; Shogo said and glanced up at the roof.<br>
By the time he lowered his eyes, the tension in his cheeks was gone.<br>
&quot;It's true.<br>
That's how you two looked.<br>
So I decided I wanted to help you guys out, unconditionally.&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Shuya nodded.<br>
After a while Noriko said, &quot;I bet…&quot; Shuya looked over at Noriko, who continued, &quot;…she was just terrified… and confused.&quot;<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Shogo shook his head.<br>
&quot;I…1 really loved Keiko.<br>
But there must have something about the way I treated her when we were going out.<br>
That's what I think it came down to.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's so wrong,&quot; Shuya adamantly insisted.<br>
Shogo looked over at him, his arms folded over his pulled-up knees.<br>
The smoke from the cigarette in his hands drifted up gently like silk.<br>
&quot;There was a misunderstanding.<br>
A small misunderstanding, I'm sure.<br>
Given how fucked up this game is.<br>
The odds were against you.<br>
That's what it really came down to, right?&quot;<br>
Shogo grimaced wryly again and only replied, &quot;I don't know.<br>
I'll never know.&quot; Then he tossed his cigarette into the puddle and took out the bird call from his pocket.<br>
&quot;This…&quot; he said, &quot;…unlike most city kids, Keiko loved to go on mountain walks.<br>
The Sunday after the week that fucking game happened she was supposed to take me bird watching.&quot; He raised the bird call between his right thumb and index finger up to his eyes and examined it as if it were a jewel.<br>
&quot;She gave this to me.&quot; He smiled and looked at Shuya and Noriko.<br>
&quot;This is the only thing I have left of hers.<br>
It's my lucky charm...Didn't bring much luck, I guess.&quot;<br>
As he put it away, Noriko returned the photo.<br>
Shogo put it back in his wallet, which he tucked into his back pocket.<br>
Noriko said, &quot;Hey, Shogo.&quot; Shogo looked up at her.<br>
&quot;I don't know how Keiko felt at the time.<br>
But…&quot;<br>
She flicked her tongue against her lips to moisten them.<br>
&quot;But I think Keiko loved you in her own way.<br>
She had to…I mean, she looks so happy in that photo.<br>
Don't you think?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br>
&quot;Of course, she did.&quot; Noriko nodded.<br>
&quot;And if I were Keiko…I would want you to live.<br>
I wouldn't want you to die for me.&quot;<br>
Shogo grinned and shook his head.<br>
&quot;Well, that's just a difference in opinion.&quot;<br>
&quot;But,&quot; Noriko insisted, &quot;please take it into consideration.<br>
Okay, please?&quot;<br>
Shogo's lips moved as if he were on the verge of saying something…but then he shrugged and smiled.<br>
Sadly.<br>
He checked his watch and went out from under the roof to tweak the bird call.<br>
4 students remaining<br>
73<br>
It had stopped raining completely by the sixth time Shogo tweaked the bird call.<br>
It was now 5:55 p.m., but the light which now seemed brilliant, compared to the preceding hours, enveloped the island.<br>
They removed the thatched roof from the rock wall.<br>
After sitting against the rock wall, the open sky up above, Noriko said, &quot;The sky's clear.&quot; Shuya and Shogo both nodded.<br>
A soft breeze rustled by.<br>
Shogo put another cigarette in his mouth and lit it.<br>
Staring at Shogo's profile, Shuya hesitated over whether he should bring it up or not.<br>
He decided to speak out.<br>
&quot;Shogo.&quot;<br>
The cigarette dangling from one end of his mouth, Shogo looked up.<br>
&quot;What about you? What did you want to be?&quot;<br>
Shogo snickered as he exhaled.<br>
&quot;I wanted to be a doctor.<br>
Like my old man.<br>
That's right, I thought at least a doctor could help people, even in this fucked up country.&quot;<br>
Shuya felt relieved.<br>
&quot;Then why don't you become one? You're certainly talented enough.&quot;<br>
Tapping the ashes off his cigarette, Shogo shook his head, as if to say this discussion was over.<br>
Noriko said, &quot;Shogo.&quot; He looked at Noriko.<br>
&quot;I know I'm repeating myself, but I have to say it.<br>
If I were Keiko, this is what I'd say.&quot; She looked up at the sky, now tinged with orange, and continued, &quot;Please live.<br>
Talk, think, act.<br>
And sometimes listen to music...&quot; She stopped, then she continued, &quot;Look at paintings at times to be moved.<br>
Laugh a lot, and at times, cry.<br>
And if you find a wonderful girl, then you go for her and love her.&quot;<br>
It was poetic.<br>
Pure poetry.<br>
And then Shuya thought, oh.<br>
These are Noriko's words.<br>
And words along with music had an incredible, holy power.<br>
Shogo listened without saying a word.<br>
Noriko continued.<br>
&quot;Because that's the Shogo that I really loved.&quot; Then she looked over at Shogo.<br>
She seemed slightly embarrassed, but added, &quot;That's what I would have said.&quot;<br>
The ash on Shogo's cigarette grew longer.<br>
Shuya said, &quot;Come on, Shogo.<br>
Aren't there ways to tear up this country without dying? It might be a roundabout way but still…&quot; He continued, &quot;I mean we got to be such good friends.<br>
We'd really miss you.<br>
Let's go to America, the three of us.&quot;<br>
Shogo fell silent.<br>
Then realizing his cigarette was burnt down to the filter, he tossed it away.<br>
He looked up at them.<br>
He was on the verge of saying something.<br>
Shuya thought, that's right, come with us, Shogo.<br>
We'll be together.<br>
We're a team.<br>
&quot;Hey—&quot;<br>
It was the all-too-familiar voice of Sakamochi.<br>
Shuya quickly lifted his left arm with his right hand and checked his watch.<br>
The muddy display read 6<br>
p.m., exactly, five seconds past the hour.<br>
&quot;Can you hear me? Well, I guess there aren't too many of you left who can hear.<br>
Now then, I will announce the dead.<br>
Now in the boy's group…&quot;<br>
Shuya was already thinking.<br>
There were only four boys left, Shuya, Shogo, Hiroki, and Kazuo Kiriyama.<br>
(Of course the same was true with the girls, Noriko, Kayoko Kotohiki, Mitsuko Souma, and Mizuho Inada.) Kazuo couldn't die so easily.<br>
And Hiroki had sent the signal.<br>
So none of the boys were dead.<br>
But…<br>
&quot;…we have only one.<br>
No.<br>
11, Hiroki Sugimura.&quot;<br>
Shuya's eyes opened wide.<br>
4 students remaining<br>
PART FOUR<br>
FINISH<br>
4 students remaining<br>
74<br>
&quot;Now then, with the girls, the body count was pretty high.<br>
No.<br>
1, Mizuho Inada, No.<br>
2 Yukie Utsumi, No.<br>
8 Kayoko Kotohiki, No.<br>
9 Yuko Sakaki, No.<br>
11 Mitsuko Souma, No.<br>
12 Haruka Tanizawa, No.<br>
16 Yuka Nakagawa, No.<br>
17 Satomi Noda, and No.<br>
19 Chisato Matsui.&quot;<br>
Shuya's eyes met Noriko's.<br>
Her eyes were trembling.<br>
They had already been prepared to hear about Yukie's group, but Hiroki and Kayoko too? And Mitsuko Souma…and Mizuho Inada.<br>
Basically…did it mean the only ones left were them and Kazuo?<br>
&quot;That can't be—&quot; Shuya uttered.<br>
Ever since the smoke signal went up, there hadn't been any gunfire.<br>
Or was Hiroki stabbed? Or… did he not hear Sakamochi's announcement correctly? Were his ears playing tricks on him?<br>
No.<br>
Sakamochi continued, &quot;All right then.<br>
Now there are four students remaining.<br>
Can you hear me, Kiriyama, Kawada, Nanahara, and Nakagawa? Wonderful work.<br>
I'm really proud of you all.<br>
Now then, I'll announce the new forbidden zones.&quot;<br>
Before Shuya could mark his map, Shogo said, &quot;Gather your stuff.&quot;<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; Shuya asked, but Shogo only signaled for him to hurry up.<br>
Sakamochi continued, &quot;From 7 p.m…&quot;<br>
&quot;Get up.<br>
It's Kazuo.<br>
It's likely he somehow found out about Hiroki's method to contact us.<br>
We might have been sending our signal to Kazuo all this time.&quot;<br>
Shuya immediately got up.<br>
Noriko was carrying her day pack on her shoulders.<br>
Then right before or after Sakamochi finished his announcement saying, &quot;All right then, do your best.<br>
Just a little more to go—&quot;<br>
Shuya saw Shogo's eyes glance at that alarm system consisting of notches cut into thin trees wrapped with thin wire.<br>
And then he saw this wire fall off the rain-drenched tree trunk.<br>
&quot;Duck!&quot; Shogo yelled.<br>
The rattling burst through.<br>
Right above Shuya and Noriko's heads, the rock wall burst into sparks.<br>
Its shards rained down on them.<br>
Crouched, Shogo held the Uzi and shot into the shrubs.<br>
Maybe he was hit or maybe he wasn't, Kazuo (who else could it be now?) didn't return fire.<br>
Shogo said,<br>
&quot;This way! Hurry!&quot; They ran south along the rock wall away from Kazuo.<br>
Once they reached the area beyond the rock wall where Shogo had been using the bird call, they heard a gun rattle off again.<br>
It missed them.<br>
They entered the bushes ahead.<br>
There was a crevice in the rock waist deep, less than a meter wide.<br>
Covered with dirt and leaves, it continued southward.<br>
Shuya didn't know about its existence, but Shogo probably chose their position with this place in mind.<br>
It was a naturally formed trench.<br>
Shogo urged them on.<br>
Shuya and Noriko jumped down.<br>
Shogo rattled off his Uzi and followed them.<br>
A different rattling followed from behind.<br>
A thin tree with roots along the edge of the crevice exploded with a pop right by Shuya's head.<br>
&quot;Run!&quot; Shogo shouted, and they ran down the crevice.<br>
Shuya almost tripped over a dry branch lying on the ground, but he managed to regain his footing and followed after Noriko.<br>
Behind them, the two guns exchanged shots.<br>
Suddenly Noriko stopped as if she were hit by something.<br>
She moaned and crouched over.<br>
Shuya, who was turned towards Shogo, quickly ran to Noriko.<br>
Did she trip over something?<br>
No.<br>
She looked up at Shuya.<br>
A cut ran under her left eye and blood gushed down her cheek.<br>
Maybe her right hand was cut too then.<br>
It was also bloody.<br>
The Browning that had been in her hand was on the ground by her feet.<br>
Shuya put his right hand on her shoulder, looked up, and found…a thin, twisted wire stretched out across the crevice, neck-high.<br>
It didn't matter where Kazuo had found it (he'd probably unfastened the wire used to secure some object).<br>
Kazuo had already anticipated their escape by this route.<br>
At Shuya's height the wire would have cut right into his neck.<br>
At least this didn't happen to Noriko—but she could have lost her sight.<br>
Shuya was furious.<br>
I don't know what Kazuo's about.<br>
Shogo had said, &quot;He just chooses as he goes.&quot; I don't know if he's abnormal or normal, or a kind of genius or madman, but hurting Noriko, that was just unforgivable.<br>
I'm going to kill that motherfucker!<br>
He tucked his CZ75 in front to help Noriko up, picked up the Browning, and then held Noriko's shoulder with the gun in his hand.<br>
Noriko staggered but managed to get up.<br>
Shogo caught up as he fired away.<br>
He glanced back at the two of them and then—maybe he caught a glance of the wire—clenched his teeth.<br>
As he turned around again, Shuya saw beyond him Kazuo Kiriyama in his school coat jump into the crevice.<br>
Shogo yelled, &quot;Duck!&quot; as he fired away.<br>
Holding his machine gun, Kazuo quickly ducked behind a curve in the crevice.<br>
Shogo's shots tore at the rock along the curve.<br>
Dust flew up.<br>
&quot;Run!&quot; Shogo repeated.<br>
Shuya held Noriko up and proceeded to run under the wire.<br>
He slowed down though, in case of any more wire traps.<br>
Shuya was frustrated.<br>
If he could only use both of his arms he could pummel Kazuo with bullets while he held Noriko.<br>
Shogo continued firing away as he stuck close to them from behind.<br>
Kazuo also returned gunfire as he approached them.<br>
The crevice that continued for fifty or sixty meters came to an end.<br>
Shuya leaped up to the ground before Noriko.<br>
He took Noriko's uninjured left hand and pulled her up.<br>
Noriko bravely stiffened her face to conceal her pain, but the left half of her face was now covered with blood.<br>
&quot;Don't stop!&quot; Shogo yelled over the gunfire.<br>
Shuya pulled Noriko's hand and dashed into the bushes ahead.<br>
Once they came out of the bushes, they found themselves in the front yard of a residential house built against the side of the mountain.<br>
It was an old single-story building.<br>
There was a white light truck right next to an entrance road in front of the house.<br>
For some reason there was a washer and refrigerator, both on their sides, loaded in the light truck.<br>
Were they being dumped?<br>
&quot;Get behind the truck!&quot; Shogo's shouted again.<br>
Shuya and Noriko stepped onto the rain-drenched soil.<br>
Holding each others hands, they made their way behind the truck.<br>
By the time Shogo followed and slid in, Shuya had Noriko sit down, the Browning in his hand.<br>
He caught a glimpse of a figure moving in the shrubs.<br>
He shot several times at it.<br>
He felt a searing pain through his left shoulder, from the bullet lodged inside it.<br>
The pain sizzled, but he had to ignore it.<br>
Shogo reloaded a magazine into his Uzi and handed it over to Shuya.<br>
He said, &quot;Shoot away.<br>
Hold him back.&quot;<br>
Shuya put his Browning down by his feet, took the Uzi, and fired away at the area where Kazuo appeared again.<br>
Kazuo didn't shoot back.<br>
As Shuya peeked above the pickup truck rack, Noriko planted herself right next to him.<br>
In her hands was the Browning he had put down.<br>
&quot;Are you all right, Noriko?&quot; he asked as he checked for Kazuo's movements in the shrubs.<br>
&quot;I'm okay,&quot; Noriko replied.<br>
Shuya glanced beyond Noriko over at Shogo.<br>
Shogo opened the door, dove into the driver's seat, and started working on something.<br>
With the sudden revving sound, the truck Shuya and Noriko were leaning against began to vibrate.<br>
The revving became a low hum as the water drops on the truck body began trickling with the soft vibration.<br>
Shogo poked his head out.<br>
&quot;Come on! We're getting out of here! Noriko, hurry!&quot;<br>
Shogo offered her his hand and helped her into the truck.<br>
&quot;Shuya! The front passenger's seat!&quot;<br>
Shogo shouted as he started backing up the truck.<br>
He steered the wheel, backed the truck towards Kazuo, and then turned it around.<br>
The passenger's seat door was there for Shuya.<br>
Noriko opened the door.<br>
The rattling exploded as Shuya reached out his right hand to get in.<br>
This time though, it was accompanied by a hammering sound.<br>
A hole formed in front in the trucks narrow cabin ceiling and the exiting bullet tore through the windshield from inside right in front of Shogo.<br>
Shuya leaned against the truck—he knew where Kazuo was now—pointed the Uzi upward and fired away.<br>
The shadow slipped away into the bushes surrounding the houses up in the side of the mountain.<br>
Kazuo had made his way up there.<br>
Without a second to lose, Shuya leaped into the passenger's seat.<br>
Shogo pulled the car out.<br>
The truck slid out onto the unpaved entrance road.<br>
The machine gun rattled, shredding the hose of the washer on the rack.<br>
It thrashed in the air like a snake, fell off the car, and vanished behind them.<br>
The gunfire ceased.<br>
&quot;Are you all right, Noriko?&quot; Shuya asked.<br>
In between Shuya and Shogo, Noriko tilted her face, covered in red, and nodded.<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; But her body was still tense.<br>
She still held onto the Browning.<br>
Shuya put the Uzi in his right hand between his thighs, pulled out a bandanna from his pocket, and wiped her face.<br>
Blood came pouring out of the wound, and her pink flesh showed underneath.<br>
A simple operation wasn't enough to remove the scar from this wound.<br>
To do this to a girl…<br>
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Shuya looked over at Shogo, who steered the wheel.<br>
&quot;He already knew where we were a while ago.<br>
That's how he knew about our escape route.&quot;<br>
But Shogo shook his head, saying, &quot;No.&quot; As he quickly shifted gears to weave his way through the winding road, he said, &quot;He couldn't have known for sure.<br>
He only figured it out at the very end.<br>
Otherwise, he would have shown up before Sakamochi's announcement.<br>
We would have come out welcoming him, thinking it was Hiroki, and then he would have easily finished us off.<br>
He didn't know where we were, so during the breaks between the bird calls he planted that wire to bide his time.<br>
He probably planted that wire in other spots too.&quot;<br>
Shuya then thought, I see.<br>
That might have been true.<br>
To bide his time.<br>
But that was what ended up severely injuring Noriko.<br>
He said, &quot;Noriko, show me your right hand.&quot;<br>
Noriko then finally let go of her gun (its grip was also covered in blood) and gave Shuya her hand.<br>
It seemed small and frail, but there was a sharp tear running down between her middle and ring finger.<br>
The palm of her hand was covered with a web of blood in the pattern of the textured pistol grip.<br>
He surmised, the wire must have cut her face first and then as she fell, it must have torn through her hand she put forward as she fell.<br>
The wound might have been much more severe if the gun hadn't been in her hand.<br>
Shuya wanted to wrap a bandanna, but realized he couldn't use his left hand.<br>
Noriko said, &quot;I'm okay.<br>
I'll do it.&quot; She took the bandanna from Shuya, flapped it, and spread it out, and then wrapped it around her right hand.<br>
She folded the edges and tied it up.<br>
Then she held the Browning again.<br>
Beyond the bullet-ridden front windshield the view suddenly opened up.<br>
The truck was descending the mountain.<br>
Under the sunset, the flat field widened between the mountainous woods.<br>
Shuya realized something urgent and said, &quot;Shogo.<br>
We're heading into a forbidden zone—&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't worry.<br>
I know what I'm doing.&quot; Shogo answered as he looked ahead.<br>
&quot;Did you hear? The forbidden zones are B=9 after 7 p.m., E=10 after 9 p.m., and F=4 after 11 p.m.<br>
Add those to the map.&quot;<br>
Shuya remembered too.<br>
He pulled out the worn out map from his pocket, spread it out on his thighs, and marked off the areas while the truck shook.<br>
The truck descended and passed by houses.<br>
It entered a road equally wide, but paved this time.<br>
The southern mountain was visible beyond the row of fields.<br>
On the right was a low hill.<br>
On the left approximately two hundred meters away was a residential house (it seemed to be in a forbidden zone).<br>
There were two more ahead slightly to its left.<br>
And then beyond were scattered houses leading up to the residential area on the island's eastern shore.<br>
In front of that region there was the field, now hidden in the shade of the low hill, where they first encountered Kazuo .<br>
One more hill over was the school, which was also hidden from view.<br>
Shogo slowed the truck down and continued forward.<br>
And now the wide longitudinal road crossing the island was right there in front of them.<br>
They passed through the fields and came onto the road.<br>
Shogo turned the wheel and turned it again.<br>
He stopped the truck in the middle of the road, its engine idling.<br>
Shogo then lunged at the cracked front windshield with his fist and knocked the entire window out onto the front of the truck.<br>
The glass made a shattering sound.<br>
&quot;Check the map,&quot; Shogo said, his hand back on the steering wheel.<br>
Shuya picked up the map again.<br>
&quot;According to my memory we should still be able to take this road all the way east.<br>
Am I right?&quot;<br>
Shuya checked the map with Noriko.<br>
&quot;Yeah, that's right.<br>
But F=4 ahead is going to be shut off at 11<br>
p.m.&quot;<br>
&quot;That won't matter,&quot; Shogo said, his eyes glaring ahead.<br>
The black, rain-drenched asphalt stretched out in a straight line.<br>
&quot;So this road should be okay right up to the eastern residential area?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right.<br>
We're fine up to the front of the curve.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded in response.<br>
Shuya poked his head out of the window again and looked back.<br>
&quot;What about Kazuo?&quot;<br>
Shogo looked at Shuya.<br>
&quot;He'll be coming.<br>
How could he not? Take a close—&quot; he said when an old, worn out, light-olive minivan suddenly appeared after turning the curve of the mountain road they'd just descended.<br>
Shuya immediately realized it was the vehicle parked by the house they had just passed by.<br>
Shogo adjusted the rearview mirror, looked at it, and said, &quot;See?&quot;<br>
It quickly closed in on them, and the moment Shuya confirmed Kazuo was sitting in the driver's seat, a burst of shots came exploding out.<br>
Shuya tucked his head back in.<br>
The bullets hit the truck with a clanging sound.<br>
Shogo shifted gears, and the truck moved out onto the wide road, heading east.<br>
As Shuya leaned out of the window looking back, Kazuo's minivan also got on the same road.<br>
Shuya fired his Uzi.<br>
Following Kazuo's reflexes, the minivan smoothly moved to the right and dodged the shots.<br>
&quot;Aim good, Shuya.&quot;<br>
By then Kazuo's minivan had sped up and caught up to them.<br>
&quot;Shogo! Can't you drive faster!?&quot;<br>
&quot;Calm down,&quot; Shogo said and steered the wheel slowly from left to right—probably so Kazuo couldn't aim at the tires.<br>
Kazuo began shooting again, and Shuya tucked his head in.<br>
It seemed Kazuo had also smashed his windshield so he could have better control of his gun.<br>
Shuya leaned out again and fired away at Kazuo's torso.<br>
Kazuo steered away and dodged the gunfire.<br>
He hardly ducked.<br>
The row of shells popping out of the ejection port suddenly stopped, and the Uzi trigger mechanism made a locking sound.<br>
Shuya realized he was out of bullets.<br>
Shogo leaned over Noriko and gave him another magazine.<br>
Before Shuya could take it, Kazuo's minivan suddenly came up to them.<br>
Shuya pulled out his CZ75 and fired away.<br>
Undeterred, Kazuo came at them.<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
His profile broke into a slight grin.<br>
&quot;You're dead wrong if you think you can beat me driving.&quot;<br>
Shogo suddenly made a sharp turn.<br>
He simultaneously pulled on the side brake with his left hand.<br>
Shuya was thrust to his side.<br>
The truck spun around the entire road like a car in a chase scene.<br>
While the truck spun around, Kazuo's minivan came racing at them.<br>
The familiar rattling sound burst at them from the driver's seat.<br>
The rearview mirror shattered above Noriko's head.<br>
&quot;Duck!&quot; Shogo yelled.<br>
But Shuya was busy firing away at Kazuo with his CZ75.<br>
It was a miracle Kazuo's machine gun bullets missed Shuya.<br>
But Shuya's shots also ended up missing Kazuo too.<br>
As the truck's front bumper skimmed by the minivan's left frontside, Shuya got a close up view of the eternally frigid eyes of Kazuo Kiriyama.<br>
The tires screeched against the wet surface.<br>
The spinning finally halted.<br>
By the time it stopped, the hunter and the hunted were reversed.<br>
Shogo had managed to dodge the front of Kazuo's minivan, completing a full spin.<br>
Kazuo's minivan was in front.<br>
Shogo immediately accelerated forward.<br>
The engine whirred away with a sudden surge of power, and the pickup lunged forward towards the back of the minivan.<br>
Kazuo was turning around.<br>
&quot;Fire away, Shuya! Everything you got!&quot; Shogo yelled.<br>
He didn't have to be told.<br>
Shuya squeezed the trigger of his reloaded Uzi with all his might and fired away with the gun on full auto.<br>
He knew the scorching, empty shells were bursting out at Noriko, but he couldn't be concerned about that.<br>
The minivan's rear windshield burst apart.<br>
Along with a popping sound, the rear hatch opened up.<br>
Then the right tire was blown out with a popping sound.<br>
Shuya was out of bullets, but the minivan was now tottering over to the edge of the road.<br>
Shogo stepped on the gas.<br>
He pulled up to the left side of the minivan, swerved the wheel, and smashed the right side of the truck against the minivan.<br>
The blow was hard on them, but it was nothing compared to the damage it did to Kazuo's minivan.<br>
At first, it lost control, then it slid to the right side of the road, and flew over its edge.<br>
The next moment it landed into the lower field and nosedived to the ground.<br>
Cabbage leaves flew up into the air.<br>
Suddenly, it was still.<br>
Shogo stopped the car parallel to the minivan and stepped on the emergency brake.<br>
He looked over its roof.<br>
&quot;Give me the gun, Shuya,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
Shuya gave him the Uzi.<br>
Shogo changed the magazine, extended his arm out of the window, pointed the gun at the minivan, and pulled the trigger.<br>
Shogo's hand shook vertically.<br>
Even from the front passenger's seat Shuya could tell the minivan was getting pummeled with bullets.<br>
Shogo reloaded another magazine and fired away.<br>
He inserted another magazine and emptied that one as well.<br>
Meanwhile, Noriko was inserting spare bullets into the emptied out magazine with her wounded hand.<br>
After she was done, Shogo took that too and fired away.<br>
Noriko loaded more magazines.<br>
Slightly bent over, Shuya looked at Noriko's hands, then at Shogo's, and finally at the minivan.<br>
They went through this round once, then twice.<br>
Because the Uzi was a 9mm weapon, they ended up using the bullets from the same caliber CZ75 and Noriko's Browning too.<br>
The Uzi trigger device indicated the magazine was empty with a locking sound.<br>
It was out of bullets.<br>
Blue smoke drifted up from the short muzzled Uzi.<br>
The narrow cabin was filled with the odor of gunsmoke.<br>
How many bullets had Shogo fired? The Uzi Shuya had taken from Yukie's group came with five extra magazines and plenty of spare bullets, but if they were to include the bullets from the CZ75 and the Browning wouldn't the number go up to two hundred and fifty? Or three hundred?<br>
With its left-side front passenger's seat and roof facing them, the minivan was honeycombed.<br>
It looked more like a strange beehive in the shape of a car.<br>
The sky was orange now.<br>
Shuya couldn't bother to look at it, but judging from the light, he assumed there was a nice sunset in the western sky.<br>
&quot;Did you get him?&quot; Shuya asked.<br>
Shogo was about to reply when—<br>
The minivan proceeded to move.<br>
It was backing up.<br>
It cut across the edge of the field and backed up to the shoulder of the road.<br>
Once again, towards the back of their truck.<br>
Shuya was speechless.<br>
Not only was the van's engine still functioning, Kazuo was still alive and operating the vehicle.<br>
Shogo had wagered everything by emptying their entire bullet supply and yet…Kazuo was still alive!<br>
Beyond the bullet-ridden vehicle, Kazuo's upper body sprung up like a jack-in-the-box.<br>
With a machine gun.<br>
With the rattling sound, the small window above Noriko's head shattered.<br>
Two holes were punctured into the steel board next to it.<br>
The truck was a domestic model made of flimsy steel, so Shuya was surprised it had actually remained unscathed this long.<br>
This also might have been thanks to the washer and refrigerator lying on the rack.<br>
Or maybe, Shogo had loaded them, anticipating this situation.<br>
&quot;Damn it!&quot; Shogo shifted gears and moved the car out.<br>
&quot;Shoot, Shuya! Back me up!&quot;<br>
Shuya fired his CZ75 at Kazuo's minivan.<br>
Kazuo fired back, the bullets landing right next to Shuya's face as sparks flew from the steel frame of the truck.<br>
Shuya immediately emptied his gun.<br>
He changed the magazine and fired.<br>
Then he realized, once I shoot this round, I'm out of bullets.<br>
We'll only have Noriko's Browning and her extra magazine.<br>
That's it.<br>
While he hesitated, Kazuo fired.<br>
He heard the rattle.<br>
A zinging sound.<br>
More sparks this time from the refrigerator on the rack.<br>
The small door on the freezer swung open and fell out.<br>
&quot;Shogo! I'm out of bullets!&quot;<br>
Shogo calmly steered the wheel.<br>
&quot;His machine gun will be useless too.<br>
He doesn't have time to reload it.&quot;<br>
Just as Shogo said, single shots came at them now.<br>
BLAM, POP.<br>
The seat by Noriko's shoulder exploded.<br>
&quot;Noriko! Get down!&quot; Shuya yelled, stuck his arm out of the window, pointed at Kazuo, who now held a gun in one hand, and fired.<br>
He was out of bullets.<br>
He took the Browning from Noriko's hand.<br>
He fired again.<br>
To the left of the pickup, between the houses and the field, was a warehouse burnt to the ground.<br>
That must have been what Shogo had been referring to, the building that went up in flames in the late night explosion.<br>
Now they had less than two hundred meters before hitting the curve that led to the residential area on the eastern side of the island.<br>
&quot;Hey, Shogo, that's—&quot;<br>
Shogo replied, &quot;I know,&quot; and swerved the wheel to the left.<br>
The left side of the truck under Shuya's body floated up.<br>
But once it regained its balance, the truck leaped onto the unpaved road.<br>
It was another road twisting through the fields, heading back up to the northern mountain.<br>
Kazuo followed after them in the minivan.<br>
Shuya aimed and fired.<br>
Kazuo ducked and fired away.<br>
This time the steel board right next to Shogo's head was punctured.<br>
&quot;Shuya! Just keep on shooting until you're out! Don't let him shoot!&quot; Shogo yelled, hunched over the wheel.<br>
Shuya noticed the left shoulder of his school coat was torn and bleeding.<br>
He'd been hit by Kazuo.<br>
Shuya was about to protest, but he leaned out of the window and fired.<br>
Shogo might plan on escaping into the mountain again.<br>
If so, then the thing was to make sure Kazuo couldn't shoot.<br>
Or by some stroke of luck, maybe I'll end up hitting him—<br>
He fired.<br>
And now the Browning was emptied out, the breechblock held open.<br>
He was out of bullets.<br>
They were approaching the mountain.<br>
A familiar sight.<br>
Strangely enough, there was a farmhouse surrounded by a concrete wall.<br>
And a field.<br>
A tractor.<br>
Shuya realized this was where they first fought against Kazuo.<br>
But now they were on the opposite side.<br>
&quot;Shogo, I'm out of bullets! Are we escaping into the mountain!?&quot;<br>
Shuya could make out Shogo's profile breaking into a slight grin.<br>
He replied, &quot;Oh, we still got bullets.&quot;<br>
Shuya knit his brows, puzzled.<br>
The truck ran off the entrance road that led to the farmhouse and dashed onto the ridge road.<br>
He passed by the side of the tractor.<br>
The road ahead became too narrow for the truck.<br>
Shogo didn't seem to care and drove the truck straight ahead.<br>
Kazuo came after them, maintaining the same distance behind—only twenty meters.<br>
He fired from the driver's seat.<br>
The truck dove into the farm and stopped.<br>
The side of the front passenger's seat where Shuya sat now faced Kazuo.<br>
Shogo kicked open the door and yelled, &quot;Get out, this way!&quot; He jumped out of the car.<br>
Shuya nudged Noriko, crouched down and followed them.<br>
He glanced back.<br>
Kazuo's minivan was coming right at them!<br>
There was a blast.<br>
The left front tire of Kazuo's minivan was blown off.<br>
It was only ten meters in front of them.<br>
The minivan tottered…and slid along the ridge of the elevated field on the left, and its front went up in the air like a surfboard taking on a large wave.<br>
The next moment it rolled over on its roof into the field.<br>
Right before or after the minivan came to a complete halt, a black shadow leaped out.<br>
By the time it somersaulted and came to a kneeling position, Shuya could see it was Kazuo.<br>
Sparks flew out from his hands with a continuous popping noise.<br>
Then there was another blast.<br>
Shuya was still inside the truck as he saw it through the window of the passenger's seat: the sight of Kazuo Kiriyama's body being blown back like an arrow.<br>
Kazuo landed on the field with a thud.<br>
He was completely still.<br>
Shuya suddenly recalled the way Kyoichi Motobuchi had died.<br>
His sausage-factory trash-bin stomach.<br>
Kazuo was too far away to check the condition of his stomach.<br>
Still, given how he was pummeled with shotgun pellets, there was no way he could have been alive.<br>
Then Shuya finally emerged from the truck.<br>
He saw Shogo holding that shotgun—the one Shuya had tossed into the field when he was running away from Kazuo—as he rose from behind the truck rack.<br>
&quot;Oh, we still got bullets.&quot; Shogo had picked up the shotgun Shuya tossed away yesterday, loaded the shotgun cartridges he still had (he must have only been able to load two shots in that span of time), and fired away…and shot down Kazuo.<br>
&quot;Right at the beginning…&quot; Shogo said slowly, &quot;…he missed us with his surprise attack.<br>
So he lost.<br>
Because then he had to take on all three of us.&quot;<br>
He took a deep breath, put down the shotgun which thumped against the refrigerator on the truck rack, and took out a pack of Wild Sevens from his pocket.<br>
He took one out and lit it.<br>
&quot;You're bleeding, Shogo,&quot; Noriko said, pointing at his left shoulder.<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Shogo glanced at his wound and then grinned.<br>
&quot;It's nothing.&quot; He exhaled.<br>
Bang.<br>
Shogo's body bent over.<br>
The Wild Seven cigarette fell from his mouth, leaving a trace of smoke in the air.<br>
The stubbly face contorted.<br>
His eyes gazed down at Shuya's feet.<br>
Shuya saw Kazuo's raised torso on the lower field, holding a gun in his right hand.<br>
He was still alive! But his stomach had been pummeled by the shotgun blast!<br>
Shogo's body slowly caved in.<br>
Kazuo quickly pointed his gun at Shuya.<br>
Shuya realized that he was, along with Shogo, no longer behind the truck.<br>
He had no gun in his hand.<br>
No, he had no bullets.<br>
It was too late for him to reload the shotgun on the truck rack.<br>
It was way too late.<br>
The small muzzle of Kazuo's gun a good ten meters away looked like a giant tunnel.<br>
A black hole engulfing everything.<br>
Bang.<br>
Shuya instantly closed his eyes.<br>
He felt a piercing sensation run through his chest and thought, oh, man, I'm dying.<br>
He opened his eyes.<br>
He wasn't dead.<br>
There was Kazuo in the diagonal orange light of the setting sun, a red dot punctured by his nose.<br>
The gun fell from his hand.<br>
He immediately fell back and crashed onto the ground.<br>
Shuya slowly turned his head to his left.<br>
Noriko was standing, holding the Smith &amp; Wesson .38 caliber revolver with both of her hands.<br>
Wow.<br>
So that's what it was.<br>
While Shogo loaded the shotgun, Noriko had also loaded the revolver Shuya had tossed aside yesterday with her remaining .38 Special bullets.<br>
Noriko's hands were trembling with the gun.<br>
&quot;Huh.&quot; Shogo stood up before Shuya could even help him up.<br>
Shuya nervously asked, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br>
Shogo didn't respond.<br>
He picked up the shotgun, and as he loaded it with the cartridges in his pocket, he walked toward Kazuo.<br>
Exactly two meters in front of him, he pointed the gun at Kazuo's head and pulled the trigger.<br>
Kazuo's head flinched only once.<br>
Shogo turned on his heels and came back.<br>
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Shuya asked him again.<br>
&quot;Yeah, I'm fine.&quot;<br>
Shogo walked over to Noriko, gently held her hands, still holding the Smith &amp; Wesson, and lowered them.<br>
He quietly said, &quot;He's dead.<br>
I'm the one who killed him, not you.&quot; Then he looked over at Kazuo.<br>
&quot;So he was wearing a vest,&quot; he said.<br>
Shuya then finally understood.<br>
Kazuo Kiriyama had been wearing a bulletproof vest.<br>
&quot;Shogo,&quot; Noriko asked, her voice slightly trembling.<br>
&quot;Are you really all right?&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled kindly and nodded.<br>
&quot;I'm all right.<br>
Thanks, Noriko.&quot; Then he took out his pack of cigarettes again.<br>
It seemed empty so he looked around and picked up the lit cigarette which had fallen from his mouth, and slowly raised it to his mouth.<br>
Shuya turned around and stared out at the sun setting over the island.<br>
It was over.<br>
At least this wonderful game was.<br>
And now, including Kazuo Kiriyama over there, thirty-nine of their dead classmates were lying sprawled all over the island.<br>
Shuya had that dizzy spell again.<br>
Maybe his thoughts were numbed by this hollow feeling.<br>
What the hell was this all about?<br>
Faces flashed by one by one.<br>
Yoshitoki Kuninobu's face as he shouted, &quot;I'll kill you!&quot; Shinji Mimura's face grinning slightly as Shuya left.<br>
Tatsumichi Oki's face as he swung the axe with bloodshot eyes.<br>
Hiroki Sugimura who vanished into the dark outside the medical clinic, saying, &quot;I have to see Kayoko Kotohiki,&quot;<br>
Hirono Shimizu as she ran away from Shuya after shooting down Kaori Minami.<br>
The tearful Yukie Utsumi saying, &quot;I just wouldn't know what to do if you died.&quot; Yuko Sakaki, who pried Shuya's fingers loose.<br>
Then the cold eyes of Kazuo Kiriyama, who'd cornered them until now.<br>
They were all gone.<br>
Not just everyone's lives, but so many other things were destroyed.<br>
But it wasn't over yet.<br>
&quot;Shogo,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
Shogo looked up, shortened cigarette in hand.<br>
&quot;We should treat you.&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled.<br>
&quot;I'm all right.<br>
It's nothing.<br>
Take care of Noriko's wounds.&quot; Then he said, &quot;I'm going to collect Kazuo's weapons.&quot; He walked over to the overturned minivan.<br>
3 students remaining<br>
75<br>
Shogo led the way up the mountain.<br>
The weapons he picked out of Kazuo's assortment were tossed into the day pack on his shoulders.<br>
He didn't offer them to Noriko or Shuya.<br>
It wasn't necessary for the time being.<br>
Shuya followed Shogo as he held Noriko up on his left side.<br>
They had cleaned Noriko's cheek wound with water for now and covered it with a row of four band-aids.<br>
Shogo said they were better off not stitching it.<br>
Shuya cleaned her hand wound and wrapped it again with the bandanna.<br>
Shogo had also quickly taken care of his wounds.<br>
It was already getting dim in the mountains, but there was no need to make their way through bushes, so it was relatively easy to climb.<br>
The ground strewn with piles of leaf mold was damp from an entire afternoon of rain.<br>
They had covered quite a distance ever since Shogo announced, &quot;We're climbing the mountain,&quot; and proceeded forward.<br>
&quot;Shogo,&quot; Shuya called.<br>
Shogo turned around.<br>
&quot;Where are we going?&quot;<br>
Shogo grinned.<br>
&quot;We have just a little more to go.<br>
Just follow me.&quot;<br>
Shuya readjusted his arm on Noriko and followed him.<br>
The peak with the viewing platform where Yukiko Kitano and Yumiko Kusaka were killed and its southern side had become a forbidden zone a long time ago.<br>
Shogo stopped right before they entered that area, in the upper mid-region of the mountain.<br>
Come to think of it, Shuya thought, a little ways below I saw Hirono Shimizu shoot Kaori Minami.<br>
&quot;This should do it,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
The slope and woods ended here, and the area offered a good view.<br>
They could see the entire island, now immersed in dim blue after sunset, where the fierce battle between the classmates of Third Year Class B Shiroiwa Junior High School took place.<br>
However, the school holding their final enemy, Sakamochi, was hidden by hills.<br>
Shuya took a deep breath.<br>
Then he asked, &quot;What's up here anyway? How are we going to escape?&quot;<br>
Shogo smiled without looking at Shuya.<br>
Then he said, &quot;Relax.<br>
Take a look over there.&quot;<br>
Shuya and Noriko looked over where Shogo was pointing.<br>
It was over the southern mountain.<br>
Although it was growing dim, they could still make out the ocean, several islands, and beyond, the mainland.<br>
Shuya could make out a mist of lights scattered over the mainland.<br>
If they were closer, they could have discerned which ones were neon lights and which ones were lights along the shore highway.<br>
Now Shuya also knew that this was Okishima Island in the Takamatsu-shi Bay.<br>
There were two others islands, Megijima and Ogijima, forming a vertical row of islands, where Okishima was the one at the far northern tip.<br>
Which meant that the small island beyond the southern mountain was Megijima, and beyond that was Ogijima, and beyond that was the mainland—Kagawa Prefecture of Shikoku.<br>
Shogo said, &quot;It's not very familiar to me, but that's your home over there.<br>
Shiroiwa-cho must be over there.<br>
You won't see it again, so have a good look.&quot;<br>
Did he mean they'd never return because they were escaping the country? Still…<br>
Shuya looked back at Shogo.<br>
&quot;Don't tell me we came all the way up here for this.&quot;<br>
Shogo snickered.<br>
&quot;Hey, what's the rush?&quot; Then he said, &quot;Show me your gun.<br>
There's something I need to check.&quot;<br>
Noriko handed over her Smith &amp; Wesson to Shogo.<br>
He opened up its cylinder and checked it.<br>
Shuya thought Noriko had reloaded it after taking that single shot at Kazuo.<br>
Shogo didn't return the gun and instead held it in his right hand.<br>
He took a deep breath and said, &quot;Do you remember how I kept on saying I might be doing this just to have a group, and that my intention might be to kill you off in the end?&quot;<br>
Shuya raised his brow.<br>
Yes, you said that, but?…<br>
&quot;Yeah, but?…&quot;<br>
&quot;So,&quot; Shogo said, &quot;you both lose.&quot;<br>
Shogo pointed the Smith &amp; Wesson at them.<br>
3 students remaining<br>
76<br>
Shuya felt a strange expression forming on his face.<br>
As if he were grinning and bewildered at the same time.<br>
Noriko probably felt the same way.<br>
&quot;What is this?&quot; Shuya said.<br>
&quot;It's not such a great time to be joking right now.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm serious,&quot; Shogo said and cocked the hammer.<br>
Shuya's grin vanished.<br>
His right arm felt Noriko stiffen.<br>
Shogo continued, &quot;You can enjoy the view a little more.<br>
I told you, it'd be the last time.&quot; His stubbly face broke into a slight grin.<br>
It was a sinister grin he'd never shown before.<br>
A crow cawed.<br>
Was it flying up above in the darkening evening sky?<br>
Shuya finally spoke.<br>
His feelings were out of sync with the situation, he could only croak out pathetically,<br>
&quot;What? What are you talking about?&quot;<br>
&quot;You are so thick,&quot; Shogo responded with a shrug.<br>
&quot;I'm going to kill you both.<br>
I'll be the winner.<br>
My second in a row.&quot;<br>
Shuya's lips were trembling.<br>
No.<br>
This cant be.<br>
He stuttered, &quot;Come on…stop it.<br>
Then…then you were just acting until now? You…you looked after us.<br>
You helped us so many times.&quot;<br>
Shogo replied calmly, &quot;You're the ones who helped me.<br>
I probably couldn't have killed Kazuo without your help.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then…so that story about Keiko was a lie too!?&quot; His words trembled.<br>
The more he tried to keep his voice down the louder it became.<br>
&quot;Yep,&quot; Shogo answered curtly.<br>
&quot;It was true I participated in the Hyogo Prefecture Program last year, and it's true there was a girl named Keiko Onuki.<br>
But there was nothing between us.<br>
The girl in that photo's my girlfriend, but her name's Kyoka Shimazaki, a totally different person.<br>
She's still in Kobe.<br>
She's out of her mind…Well, anyway, she insisted I hold onto this photo.<br>
I got to say she was a good lay, though.&quot;<br>
Shuya took a deep breath.<br>
A light early summer breeze blew against his skin, but for some reason it felt chilly.<br>
Then he cautiously asked, &quot;But what about that bird call?…&quot;<br>
Shogo had another curt response.<br>
&quot;I just happened to find that at the general supply store.<br>
I figured it'd be useful.<br>
And it proved to be, in the end.&quot;<br>
It grew darker and darker.<br>
Shogo continued, &quot;You lost the moment you trusted me,&quot; but Shuya still couldn't believe it.<br>
That can't be.<br>
That just…can't be.<br>
Then something occurred to Shuya.<br>
This…must be…<br>
Noriko spoke out before Shuya, &quot;Shogo…is this some test to see whether you can really trust us? Is it because Keiko couldn't trust you?&quot;<br>
Shogo shrugged his shoulders and said, &quot;Unbelievable how you still believe in that fairy tale.&quot;<br>
Those were his last words.<br>
Shogo held the gun in his hand and slowly pulled the trigger.<br>
Two gunshots rang out as evening descended upon the island.<br>
1 student remaining—GAME OVER—Report from Third Year Class B Shiroiwa Junior High School Program Headquarters Tracking System<br>
77<br>
Shogo Kawada (Male Student No.</li>
<li>reclined against the soft sofa on the ship.<br>
He was swaying slightly from the rough waves.<br>
The room was fairly spacious for a small patrol ship.<br>
The ceiling itself was low, but the room must have been a couple square meters.<br>
There was a low table in the middle, and two sofas on each side, with Shogo sitting on the one away from the door.<br>
Because the room was below deck it had no windows, so he couldn't see anything outside, but it must have been past 8:30 p.m.<br>
by now.<br>
The yellow ceiling lights shined against the glass ashtray.<br>
Shogo didn't have any more cigarettes to smoke, though.<br>
Once the forbidden zones were all deactivated after the game was over, Shogo obeyed Sakamochi's announcements and made his way to the school.<br>
In front of the school were the bodies of Yoshio Akamatsu and Mayumi Tendo, and inside the classroom, the bodies of Yoshitoki Kuninobu and Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, all left untouched.<br>
His silver collar was finally detached, and after the shooting for the news segment, he was taken away by soldiers and escorted to the harbor.<br>
There were two ships docked there.<br>
One for the winner…and the other a transport ship to return the soldiers packed inside the school.<br>
Most of the soldiers boarded this ship.<br>
Only the trio who were in the classroom during Sakamochi's game instructions joined Sakamochi to board Shogo's ship.<br>
And tomorrow the subcontracted clean-up crew would take care of the remaining bodies of the students on the island.<br>
The speakers and school computers at the school building would also be dismantled in a matter of days.<br>
Of course the software and data for the game had already been removed from the computer.<br>
This was the identical procedure taken immediately after the Kobe Second District Junior High School Program came to an end ten months ago.<br>
And now Shogo was waiting here.<br>
They were now south of Okishima.<br>
The patrol ship was returning directly to Takamatsu Harbor, but the soldiers' transport ship would probably alter its course and head west towards the military base.<br>
The doorknob rotated with a click.<br>
The soldier who stood guard (the uncharismatic one called<br>
&quot;Nomura&quot;) by the door looked in, then moved away.<br>
Kinpatsu Sakamochi appeared.<br>
He came in with a tray with two teacups and asked, &quot;Did I keep you waiting, Shogo?&quot; as he entered the room.<br>
Nomura closed the door.<br>
Sakamochi walked up to him with his short legs.<br>
He put the tray on the table and said, &quot;Here.<br>
It's tea.<br>
Drink all you want.&quot; He took out a flat, letter-sized envelope from under his left armpit and sat on the sofa facing Shogo.<br>
He tossed the envelope onto his side of the table, then combed back his shoulder-length hair behind his ear.<br>
Shogo glanced down at the envelope indifferently and began speaking while staring at Sakamochi.<br>
&quot;What do you want? I wish you'd leave me alone.<br>
I'm tired.&quot;<br>
&quot;There you go…&quot; Sakamochi brought the cup to his mouth with a grimace.<br>
&quot;You should be more polite with adults.<br>
I had this student Kato once.<br>
He used to give me a hard time, but now that he's grown up, he's quite respectable.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm not one of your pigs.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi opened his eyes as if taken aback and then smiled again.<br>
&quot;Come, come, Shogo.<br>
I wanted to have a nice chat with you.&quot;<br>
Shogo slouched against the sofa and folded his legs.<br>
He remained quiet as he rested his cheeks in his hands.<br>
&quot;Where should I begin?&quot; Sakamochi put his cup down and rubbed his open hands together.<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
His eyes glimmered.<br>
&quot;Did you know we have a betting pool for the Program, Shogo?&quot;<br>
Shogo squinted his eyes as if looking at filth.<br>
Then he said, &quot;I wouldn't be surprised.<br>
You guys are tasteless.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi smiled.<br>
&quot;I had my money on Kazuo.<br>
Twenty thousand yen.<br>
With my salary, that's a lot.<br>
But thanks to you, I lost.&quot;<br>
&quot;Too bad,&quot; Shogo said in a tone devoid of sympathy.<br>
Sakamochi smiled again.<br>
Then he said, &quot;I explained how I could tell where everyone was with those collars, right?&quot;<br>
The answer was obvious.<br>
Shogo didn't respond.<br>
Sakamochi stared at Shogo.<br>
&quot;You were with Shuya and Noriko throughout the game, right? Then you betrayed them in the end.<br>
That's what it came down to, right?&quot;<br>
&quot;What's wrong with that?&quot; Shogo replied.<br>
&quot;There are no restrictions in this wonderful game.<br>
Don't make me laugh.<br>
You can't criticize me for that.&quot;<br>
A broad grin spread over Sakamochi's face.<br>
He combed back his hair, took a sip of tea, and rubbed his hands.<br>
He spoke as if he were sharing a secret, &quot;Hey, Shogo.<br>
I'm not really supposed to be sharing this with anyone, but I'll tell you the truth.<br>
These collars have built-in mics, so we could hear everything the students said during the game.<br>
I bet you probably didn't know that.&quot;<br>
Shogo, who seemed so indifferent in his responses, finally seemed interested.<br>
He knit his brows and pursed his lips.<br>
&quot;How the fuck…would I know about that?&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;So then you heard everything, how I tricked them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh, that's right.&quot; Sakamochi nodded.<br>
&quot;But that wasn't very nice, Shogo.<br>
Was it.<br>
'Even if we managed to capture Sakamochi, I'm sure as far as the government's concerned he's expendable'? You said that.<br>
Being a Program Instructor is a pretty respectable occupation.<br>
Not everyone can do it.&quot;<br>
Ignoring Sakamochi's complaint, Shogo asked, &quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; Sakamochi replied.<br>
&quot;With your wonderful performance I couldn't resist telling you.&quot;<br>
&quot;This is bullshit.&quot;<br>
Shogo looked away, but Sakamochi pressed more insistently, &quot;A wonderful performance, but…&quot; Shogo looked back at him.<br>
Sakamochi continued, &quot;…there's something I don't get.&quot;<br>
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Why didn't you shoot those two right after Kazuo was killed? You could have, right? That's the one thing I just don't get.&quot;<br>
&quot;Just as I told them,&quot; Shogo, replied without hesitating, &quot;I just thought I'd let them have one last look at their home.<br>
A little gift for them before their descent into hell.<br>
You may not believe this, but I can be pretty loyal.<br>
I mean, thanks to them, I won.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi continued smiling and uttered, &quot;Hmmm.&quot; Then he raised his cup to his mouth.<br>
He sat back on the back of the sofa with the cup in his hand and spoke again, &quot;Hey, Shogo, I got hold of the data on the Kobe Second District Junior High School Program.&quot; Then he stared at Shogo.<br>
Shogo stared back at him and remained silent.<br>
&quot;And as far as I can tell from the data, nothing indicates you had any special relationship with Keiko Onuki.&quot;<br>
&quot;Onuki? Like I said I made that up,&quot; Shogo interrupted him, but Sakamochi spoke over him and continued, &quot;As—&quot; Shogo shut up.<br>
&quot;As you said, to Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, you saw Onuki twice—the first time only for a moment and then the second time right before you won, when she was already dead.<br>
Even according to the taped conversations, you never even once uttered her name.<br>
Not once.<br>
Do you remember that?&quot;<br>
&quot;How could I? It's like I said—there was nothing between me…and her.<br>
You heard me, right?&quot;<br>
&quot;But the thing is, Shogo, the second time around you stopped there for two hours.&quot;<br>
&quot;That was just a coincidence.<br>
It was a good spot to hide and rest.<br>
That's how I was able to remember that name so vividly.<br>
I tell you, she died a horrible death.&quot;<br>
His grin still glued across his face, Sakamochi nodded, hm hm.<br>
&quot;The other thing is…the entire eighteen hours which transpired in this game—which is actually quite fast, maybe the designated area was too small—in any case, you didn't exchange a single word with anyone.<br>
I mean, aside from saying things like,<br>
'Stop' or 'I'm not an enemy.' &quot;<br>
&quot;That was just an act too,&quot; Shogo interrupted him.<br>
&quot;It's so obvious.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi smiled, ignoring Shogo's statement.<br>
&quot;So I have no idea how you approached this game.<br>
You moved around a lot but—&quot;<br>
&quot;It was my first time.<br>
I didn't know how to play it smart.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi then nodded, hm hm.<br>
He held back a grin as if concealing his amusement.<br>
He sipped his tea and returned the cup to the table.<br>
Then he looked up and said, &quot;By the way…what about that photo? I'd like to look at it, if you don't mind.&quot;<br>
&quot;Photo?&quot;<br>
&quot;Come on, you showed it to Nanahara and Nakagawa, right? You said it was a photo of Onuki.<br>
Let me see it.<br>
It was actually a photo of someone named Shimazaki, right?&quot;<br>
Shogo twisted his mouth.<br>
&quot;Why should I show it to you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Come on, just show it to me.<br>
I'm your instructor.<br>
Please.<br>
Come on, please,&quot; Sakamochi said and bowed over the table.<br>
Shogo reluctantly reached around and searched his back pocket.<br>
He raised his brow and swung his hand back.<br>
It was empty.<br>
&quot;It's gone,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;I must've dropped it somewhere when we fought Kazuo.&quot;<br>
&quot;Dropped it?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh huh.<br>
It's true.<br>
I dropped my wallet.<br>
Well, I don't need it anyway.&quot;<br>
Suddenly, Sakamochi burst out laughing.<br>
As he laughed he said, &quot;I get it.&quot; He held his stomach, slapped his thighs, and kept on laughing.<br>
Shogo looked perplexed…but then he squinted his eyes.<br>
He looked up at the ceiling in the windowless room.<br>
Despite the insulation of the patrol ship's walls, he could hear the faint but definite whirring sound.<br>
It was definitely not the sound of the ship's engine.<br>
The sound became louder and louder…and then after a certain point, it receded.<br>
Then it was almost entirely gone.<br>
Shogo grimaced.<br>
&quot;Does that trouble you, Shogo?&quot; He stopped laughing.<br>
He still had that creepy smile on his face, though.<br>
&quot;That was a helicopter.&quot; He reached out for his tea again and emptied his cup.<br>
He put the empty cup on the table.<br>
&quot;It's heading toward the island where you all fought.&quot;<br>
Shogo knit his brows, but this time his reaction seemed to have a different connotation.<br>
But Sakamochi didn't care.<br>
He arrogantly leaned back on the sofa and changed the subject, &quot;Hey, Shogo.<br>
Let's talk about those collars again.<br>
Well, you know, they're actually called 'Guadalcanal No.<br>
22.' That doesn't matter.<br>
Anyway, weren't you telling Shuya about how they couldn't be dismantled?&quot;<br>
Seeing how Shogo didn't respond, Sakamochi continued, &quot;In fact, your theory was right on the mark.<br>
Each unit is equipped with three different systems, so even if one of them has a one percent margin of error, with three systems, only one in a million can break down.<br>
In reality, the chances are even slimmer.<br>
So, it's just like you said.<br>
No one can escape from them.<br>
Any attempt to remove it will ignite it, killing its wearer.<br>
It's very rare someone actually tries that, though.&quot;<br>
Shogo still remained silent.<br>
&quot;The thing is…&quot; Sakamochi then leaned over, &quot;…I just thought I'd get in touch with the Defense Forces weapons lab this time around.<br>
And guess what?&quot; He looked at Shogo.<br>
&quot;They said it could be deactivated by anyone with a basic knowledge in electronics, using basic transistor parts, the kind you find in a radio.<br>
Of course, that's assuming you already know the circuitry inside the device.&quot;<br>
Shogo stayed quiet, but as Sakamochi's continued staring at him, he suddenly said in a strange, blank tone of voice as if the thought suddenly occurred to him, &quot;I don't get it.<br>
Who could possibly have that information?&quot;<br>
Sakamochi grinned and nodded.<br>
He continued, &quot;Yes.<br>
Well, anyway, if we were to assume the collar was disabled, then obviously it would transmit a signal informing us of the wearer's death, right? In other words, if there was a student who could remove that collar, then he could survive without a hitch.<br>
He'd just have to wait out the game, and once the military leaves the premises he could take his time escaping.<br>
That's right, just like you said to Shuya Nanahara.<br>
Say the game were to end in the afternoon, then the subcontracted clean-up crew comes the following day.<br>
So there's plenty of time in between.<br>
Also, this time of year the water isn't too cold to swim in.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi gave Shogo an imploring look, but Shogo only responded with a &quot;Huh.&quot; Sakamochi leaned back on the sofa.<br>
&quot;This is absurd.<br>
The collar circuits are supposed to be top secret, right? How could a junior high school kid possibly know about it?&quot;<br>
Sakamochi replied, &quot;He could, though.&quot; Shogo looked back at Sakamochi.<br>
&quot;See, all of this information, including your records, and the Guadalcanal device, under normal circumstances I wouldn't have looked up any of this stuff.<br>
I would have just sat back, impressed by your intelligence.<br>
This time though, I was contacted by Dictator Headquarters and the Special Defense Forces before the game began.<br>
I mean, on the twentieth.&quot;<br>
Shogo stared at Sakamochi.<br>
Sakamochi continued, &quot;They said someone hacked into the government's central operations system in March.&quot; He paused.<br>
Then he added, &quot;Of course, the hacker thought he managed to leave without a trace.<br>
He was incredibly skilled, and although he encountered the administrator while he was hacking, he managed to erase his log-in access before escaping.<br>
But…&quot;<br>
Sakamochi paused again.<br>
Shogo kept quiet.<br>
&quot;…the government system has tight security.<br>
It has a another secret log-in system that records every operation.<br>
Of course, they usually don't monitor this system, and the administrator didn't think there was anything abnormal at the time.<br>
That's why they took so long to discover it.<br>
But they found it.<br>
Yes, they did.&quot;<br>
Shogo sealed his lips and stared at Sakamochi.<br>
But his Adam's apple moved ever so slightly.<br>
The movement was hardly discernible.<br>
&quot;Look,&quot; Shogo said.<br>
&quot;A subcontractor really did tell me about rounding up the corpses.<br>
I was having a few drinks at this bar with him.<br>
The topic just came up.<br>
And the instructor from our last game told us the Program hardly ever ends from just time running out.<br>
You can even ask him.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi rubbed his right hand under his nose and stared at Shogo.<br>
&quot;Why are you telling me this? I didn't even ask you about that.&quot;<br>
Shogo's Adam's apple moved again.<br>
This time it definitely moved.<br>
Sakamochi then snickered and continued, &quot;So apparently some of the hacked data included information on the Program.<br>
In other words, technical specifications on the Guadalcanal collar.<br>
Why would someone take such useless information? I mean, what's the point? Even if the hacker were to publicize it, the government would only design a new collar, and that would be the end of that.<br>
There's no sign of that for now.<br>
But maybe we can assume this much: the intruder was driven to access this information at all cost.<br>
Don't you think?&quot;<br>
Shogo didn't respond.<br>
Sakamochi sighed and picked up the envelope he'd tossed out.<br>
He flipped it over with one hand and pulled out the contents.<br>
He placed them side by side in front of Shogo.<br>
There were two photos.<br>
They were both black and white and printed on B5 paper.<br>
One of them had no contrast at all, so it was hard to tell what it was, but the other one clearly showed a truck and three black dots scattered around it.<br>
Given how it was the top of a truck, the three dots were obviously heads.<br>
&quot;You see, right?&quot; Sakamochi said.<br>
&quot;That's the three of you just a while ago.<br>
Right after you killed Kazuo.<br>
Those were taken by satellite.<br>
We don't usually do this kind of thing.<br>
But I want you to take a closer at this other photo.<br>
See? You can't really make out anything, right? But that's actually a photo of the mountain.<br>
It was taken when you shot those two.<br>
There wasn't enough light, and it's obscure because you're all hidden by the woods.<br>
That's right, you can't see it.&quot;<br>
He fell silent.<br>
The ship swayed a little, but Shogo and Sakamochi stared at each other, completely still.<br>
Then Sakamochi took a deep breath and once again combed back his hair behind his ear.<br>
He broke into a smile and spoke in a strangely intimate voice, &quot;Say, Shogo.<br>
I've been keeping track of this game from the very beginning.<br>
Right? After you shot Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, Nanahara took fifty-four seconds to die, while Nakagawa ended up taking one minute and thirty seconds to die.<br>
They should have died instantly if you shot them point blank.<br>
So what's this time lag about?&quot;<br>
Shogo was silent, but—whether he was aware of it or not—his cheeks stiffened.<br>
He managed to speak out, &quot;It can happen.<br>
I'd have thought they died immediately but—&quot;<br>
&quot;Enough.&quot; Sakamochi cut him off.<br>
He said in an adamant voice, &quot;Let's put an end to this.&quot; He looked into Shogo's eyes and nodded as if admonishing him.<br>
Then he said, &quot;Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa are still on that island.<br>
They're still alive, right? They're hiding in the mountain.<br>
You're the one who hacked into the government central system.<br>
Or one of your friends.<br>
You knew how to dismantle that collar.<br>
You knew we could monitor your conversations, so you gave us that radio drama performance of shooting those two.<br>
Then you removed their collars.<br>
Am I right? I didn't say it was a wonderful performance.<br>
You're still in the middle of that wonderful performance.&quot;<br>
Shogo gazed at Sakamochi.<br>
He grimaced through clenched teeth.<br>
Sakamochi kept on smiling and continued, &quot;Didn't you give them some messages about meeting spots?<br>
And you were supposed to hook up together later, right? Well, you can forget about that.<br>
That helicopter that just flew by is going to spray the island with poison gas.<br>
It's a composite poison mustard gas developed recently called Greater East Asia Victory No.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The guard ships are still over there.<br>
Nanahara and Nakagawa are finished.&quot;<br>
As he stared at Sakamochi, Shogo dug his fingers into the synthetic leather elbow rest.<br>
Sakamochi took another deep breath and sank back into the sofa.<br>
He combed back his hair.<br>
&quot;We have no precedent for this.<br>
Strictly speaking, you're not really the winner.<br>
But one of the education committee officials I work for bet a lot of money on you.<br>
So I decided to treat this internally.<br>
It'll help my career if I help him out…therefore, you'll be the official winner.<br>
According to the records, you'll be the killer of those two___Are you satisfied now, Shogo?&quot;<br>
Shogo was utterly stiff, as if he might start shaking any second now.<br>
But as Sakamochi raised his brow, Shogo looked away from him and stared down at the floor.<br>
&quot;I…don't know what you're talking about...&quot;<br>
he said.<br>
He nervously opened and then clenched his fist several times.<br>
He glanced back at Sakamochi and then anxiously said, &quot;Why bother spraying gas? You're just wasting tax money.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi snickered.<br>
&quot;We'll soon see whether I am.&quot; Then he said, &quot;Oh, that's right.&quot; He pulled out a small automatic pistol from under his coat and pointed it at Shogo.<br>
Shogo opened his eyes wide.<br>
&quot;I've decided to take care of you as an internal matter too.<br>
You have dangerous ideas.<br>
I think it's against this country's interests if we let someone like you live.<br>
Have to toss the rotten apple out of the box.<br>
The sooner the better.<br>
You arrive DOA due to injuries from the game.<br>
How's that? Oh, don't you worry.<br>
If you happen to have friends too, we'll hunt them down.<br>
We won't have to interrogate you.&quot;<br>
Shogo slowly tore his eyes away from the gun and looked at Sakamochi.<br>
&quot;You…&quot; he said.<br>
He was now baring his teeth.<br>
Sakamochi broke into a grin.<br>
&quot;Bastard!&quot; Shogo howled in a voice full of indignation, despair, probably mixed in with a dose of fear towards everything incomprehensible.<br>
What he wanted to do most was grab Sakamochi by the neck.<br>
But the gun restrained him.<br>
He could only clench his fists over his thighs.<br>
&quot;Don't you… do n't you have any kids? How can you accept this fucked up game?&quot;<br>
&quot;Of course I have kids,&quot; Sakamochi replied casually.<br>
&quot;You know, I like to have a good time, so we're about to have our third.&quot;<br>
Shogo didn't respond to the joke, yelling instead, &quot;Then…how can you accept this? One of your kids might end up in this game in the future! Or…or is it that…kids of high-ranked officials like you are exempted?&quot;<br>
Offended, Sakamochi shook his head.<br>
&quot;That's preposterous.<br>
How can you say that, Kawada? You read the Program Requirements, right? There are no exceptions.<br>
Of course I've done some sneaky things.<br>
Using connections to get my kid into a prestigious school.<br>
I'm human.<br>
But being human also means we have to abide by certain rules…oh, that's right, you weren't able to steal that, huh? The top secret agenda also had information on the Program.<br>
I'll tell you now, this country needs the Program.<br>
The thing is, it's not an experiment at all.<br>
Come on, why do you think we have the local news broadcast the image of the winner? Of course, viewers might feel sorry for him or her, thinking, the poor student probably didn't even want to play the game, but had no choice but to fight the others.<br>
In other words, everyone ends up concluding, you cant trust anyone, right? Which would extinguish any hope of uniting and forming a coup d'etat against the government, hm? And so the Republic of Greater East Asia and its ideals will live on for eternity.<br>
Naturally everyone has to die equally for the sake of this noble goal.<br>
I've passed this wisdom onto my kids.<br>
My oldest kid is in the second grade now and she's always saying how she'll sacrifice her life for the Republic.&quot;<br>
Shogo's cheeks began to tremble.<br>
&quot;You're…insane,&quot; he said, &quot;You're out of your mind! How can you be like that?&quot; He was nearly sobbing, &quot;A government is supposed to serve the needs of the people.<br>
We shouldn't be slaves to our own system.<br>
If you think this country makes sense…then you're insane!&quot;<br>
Sakamochi let him finish.<br>
Then he said, &quot;Hey, Kawada.<br>
You're still a kid.<br>
It looks like you guys had some talks, but I want you to think a little more.<br>
This is a marvelous country.<br>
It's the most prosperous country in the world.<br>
Well, you might not be able to travel abroad much, but its industrial exports are unsurpassed.<br>
The government's slogan is telling the truth when it claims our per capita production is the best in the world.<br>
The thing is though, this prosperity only comes as a result of unifying the population with a powerful government at the center.<br>
A certain degree of control is always necessary.<br>
Otherwise…we'll decline into a third-rate country, like the American Empire.<br>
You know, right? That country is in turmoil from all kinds of problems like drugs, violence, and homosexuality.<br>
They're living off their past glory, but it'll only be a matter of time before they fall apart.&quot;<br>
Shogo remained silent.<br>
He clenched his teeth.<br>
Then he spoke quietly, &quot;Let me say one thing.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi raised his brow.<br>
&quot;What? Go ahead.&quot;<br>
&quot;You guys might call it prosperity, but…&quot; Shogo's voice sounded tired, but still dignified, &quot;…it'll always be phony.<br>
That truth won't change even if you kill me now.<br>
You're doomed to be phony.<br>
Don't forget…that.&quot;<br>
Sakamochi shrugged his shoulders.<br>
&quot;Are you done with your speech?&quot; He pointed his gun at him.<br>
Shogo tightened his mouth and glared at Sakamochi, ignoring the gun.<br>
He seemed ready to face the consequences.<br>
&quot;Later, Kawada.&quot; Sakamochi nodded as if to bid him farewell.<br>
Then his finger began pulling the trigger when—<br>
BRRRATTA…the tapping, typewriter-like sound pierced through the room.<br>
Sakamochi's finger stopped for a moment.<br>
He glanced at the door for a split second..<br>
Jong enough to be distracted.<br>
By the time he looked back Shogo was right in front of his face.<br>
Even though there was a table in between them, he was only ten centimeters away.<br>
He'd moved instantly, like a magician, as if he'd teleported.<br>
The rattling sound continued outside the room.<br>
Shogo's left hand held down the gun in Sakamochi's right hand.<br>
Sakamochi froze up and looked up at Shogo's face, now within kissing distance.<br>
His long hair wasn't too messy.<br>
He didn't try to swing his hand loose from Shogo.<br>
He merely looked at Shogo with his mouth closed.<br>
The rattling sound again.<br>
The door opened.<br>
&quot;An attack—&quot; Nomura stopped once he grasped the situation and attempted to lift his rifle.<br>
Still holding Sakamochi's right hand down with his left hand, Shogo spun Sakamochi's body around as if dancing a tango.<br>
As he turned, he squeezed Sakamochi's index finger on the trigger and began firing away.<br>
Three shots pierced Nomura right above his heart.<br>
He groaned and collapsed.<br>
The rattling sounded louder now, with the door open.<br>
Shogo looked into Sakamochi's eyes again.<br>
Their bodies still entwined, he drove his right fist under Sakamochi's chin.<br>
Sakamochi coughed out blood.<br>
His eyes stared up at Shogo.<br>
The blood spilled from his lips, dripping down to his chin and onto the floor.<br>
&quot;I told you, it was a waste of tax money.&quot; Shogo twisted his fist further into Sakamochi's chin.<br>
Sakamochi's eyes rolled away from Shogo.<br>
Then they slowly rolled upwards.<br>
Shogo moved away from Sakamochi, and Sakamochi crashed onto the sofa.<br>
His throat was now exposed.<br>
A brown stick poked out of his windpipe like a strange ornament.<br>
Closer up, the gold logo,<br>
&quot;HB,&quot; on its butt-end was visible.<br>
This was one of those pencils that everyone, including Shogo and Shuya, had written, &quot;We will kill each other,&quot; but Kinpatsu Sakamochi probably had no idea.<br>
After glancing down at Sakamochi he tucked the gun into his belt.<br>
He dashed over to Nomura, who was lying face up, and picked up his rifle.<br>
He took the extra magazines from his belt and left the room.<br>
He opened the two doors down the corridor on the right, but there were only rows of bunk beds.<br>
No one was inside.<br>
The rattling was approaching him.<br>
A soldier came tumbling down the stairs beyond the narrow corridor.<br>
Unarmed except for the gun in his hand—maybe he'd thought he was safe now that the game was over—it was the soldier Kondo, now dead.<br>
Shogo stepped around Kondo's body, entered the staircase, and looked up.<br>
There was Shuya Nanahara (Male Student No.<br>
15) holding an Ingram M10, standing next to Noriko Nakagawa (Female Student No.<br>
15).<br>
They both looked down at him.<br>
They were soaking wet.<br>
78<br>
&quot;Shogo!&quot;<br>
Seeing that Shogo was safe, Shuya cried in relief.<br>
Upon hearing the gunfire besides his shots, he thought they might have been too late.<br>
Shogo ran upstairs' with a rifle he'd taken from one of the soldiers.<br>
&quot;So you're all right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Shogo nodded.<br>
&quot;Sakamochi's dead.<br>
Did you get rid of everyone?&quot;<br>
&quot;We got everyone on deck.<br>
But we couldn't find that one called Nomura—&quot;<br>
&quot;Then that's everyone.<br>
I got rid of Nomura,&quot; he said.<br>
He passed by them and ran to the bridge where the pilothouse was located.<br>
There was one body lying in the corridor leading to the pilothouse, then two more inside and outside the briefing room under the pilothouse.<br>
One of them was the soldier Tahara, the others were the ship's naval crew, but Tahara was the only with a gun, and it was only a pistol.<br>
Shuya had blown them away with the Ingram.<br>
There were two others lying on deck, the first naval soldiers Shuya killed.<br>
After glancing at Tahara's body, Shogo grabbed the railing that led up to the pilothouse and said, &quot;You were merciless, Shuya.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;I was.&quot;<br>
Once he was up in the pilothouse, there were two more of Shuya's victims, crew members sprawled in the corner.<br>
In the dark window were several holes formed either from stray bullets or shots that had torn through the crew members.<br>
The ship passed an island lit up with residential lights (probably Megijima).<br>
Shuya wondered whether the gunfire could be heard over there or even further into the sea around them.<br>
Well, it wasn't that uncommon to hear sudden gunfire in this country, so he wasn't too worried.<br>
Shogo looked straight ahead.<br>
Shuya and Noriko looked in the same direction and saw what looked like a gravel carrier approaching them on their right.<br>
Shogo held the steering wheel and shifted the bar next to it methodically.<br>
&quot;I hope you didn't catch a cold,&quot; Shogo asked.<br>
&quot;I'm fine.&quot;<br>
&quot;And you, Noriko?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm okay too.&quot; Noriko nodded.<br>
Shogo squinted ahead as he said, &quot;I'm sorry.<br>
I did the easy work this time.&quot; The gravel carrier was approaching.<br>
&quot;That's not true,&quot; Shuya responded as his eyes shuttled between Shogo's hands and the ship ahead of them.<br>
&quot;I wasn't in any condition to take on Sakamochi.<br>
He was armed.<br>
You were the right man.&quot;<br>
As he kept watch, the carrier loomed larger and larger.<br>
But…they managed to skim past each other.<br>
The carrier's lights receded.<br>
&quot;Phew.&quot; Shogo took a deep breath and then let go of the steering wheel.<br>
He began pressing the intricate rows of buttons on the nautical instruments.<br>
He gazed at the panel for a while, and after seeing one of the diodes go out, he took the radio transmitter.<br>
A voice came through the speaker, &quot;This is the Bisan Seto Inland Sea Traffic Advisory Service Center.&quot; That's what it sounded like.<br>
Shogo responded, &quot;This is Defense Patrol Ship DM 245-3568.<br>
We need you to confirm our location.&quot;<br>
&quot;DM 245-3568, we cannot confirm.<br>
Are you having trouble?&quot;<br>
&quot;Our DPS navigation device seems to be broken.<br>
We will stop the boat for an hour or so to repair the device.<br>
Could you notify the other ships?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes.<br>
We need your present location.&quot;<br>
Shogo read off the display on the nautical instrument.<br>
Then he ended the transmission.<br>
He was only buying time to move the ship somewhere.<br>
Shogo steered the wheel now and made a sharp left turn.<br>
Shuya felt the ship rock from the wide turn.<br>
As he cautiously handled the wheel Shogo said, &quot;That bastard Sakamochi realized what was going on.<br>
I'm glad I had you guys get on board.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
Water dripped down from his bangs.<br>
He was right.<br>
After Shogo had shot his gun twice into the air, he pressed his fingers against his mouth, signaling Shuya and Noriko, who were both blinking, to stay quiet.<br>
He took his map out of his pocket and scribbled on the backside.<br>
The note was obscured in the dim light, but they managed to read it.<br>
Then Shogo removed their collars.<br>
All he used was a wire attached to a transistor—which he had for some reason—a knife, and small screwdriver.<br>
And then Shogo took out a simple ladder made of bamboo and rope from his day pack.<br>
He scribbled more on the map, &quot;Sneak into the ship they put me on.<br>
It'll be nighttime, so you'll be fine.<br>
Make your way to the harbor by beach.<br>
There'll be a chain tied to the anchor.<br>
Tie the rope ladder to it and hold on.<br>
Once the anchor comes up, and the ship starts moving, climb up to the deck and hide behind the life preservers on the ship's stern.<br>
Then attack when the time's right.&quot;<br>
Of course…it was no easy feat holding onto this flimsy rope ladder as the ship sped up, stirred up waves, and dragged them through the sea.<br>
It was also hard to reach the deck less than half a meter above the top of the ladder.<br>
Without his left arm, Shuya just couldn't do what should have been an easy task.<br>
But Noriko managed to lift herself up there despite her wounded hand, then offered a hand to Shuya.<br>
Noriko's strength took Shuya by surprise.<br>
In any case…they managed to do it.<br>
&quot;But…&quot; Shuya said, &quot;…1 wish you'd told us about this earlier.&quot;<br>
Shogo returned the wheel to the right and coyly shrugged his shoulders.<br>
&quot;It would have made our actions less natural.<br>
Sorry, though.&quot;<br>
He let go of the wheel.<br>
The black sea spread out in front of them.<br>
For the time being, there was no sign of any ship approaching.<br>
Shogo then began checking several of the ship's meters.<br>
&quot;It's amazing,&quot; Noriko said.<br>
&quot;You managed to hack into the government computer system.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, really,&quot; Shuya agreed.<br>
&quot;You were lying about being computer illiterate.&quot;<br>
His gaze still fixed ahead, Shogo grinned.<br>
&quot;Well, they found out anyway.<br>
Anyway, it all ended up working out.&quot;<br>
Shogo seemed satisfied with the meter readings and moved away.<br>
He walked up to one of the soldiers on the floor.<br>
Wondering what he was doing, Shuya and Noriko looked on as Shogo went through his pockets.<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; he said, &quot;So even the Defense Forces aren't smoking now.&quot;<br>
He was looking for cigarettes.<br>
He did manage to extract a crumpled pack of Buster from the other soldier's breast pocket.<br>
The pack was covered in blood, but he casually pulled out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, and lit it up.<br>
He leaned against the side of the helm, and as he squinted his eyes, he exhaled contentedly.<br>
As she watched him Noriko said, &quot;If our group was too large…we wouldn't have been able to escape like this.&quot;<br>
Shogo nodded.<br>
&quot;That's true.<br>
And it had to be at night.<br>
But there's no point in going over that.<br>
We're alive.<br>
Isn't that enough?&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded.<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why don't you two go take a shower,&quot; Shogo said, &quot;It's in front of the stairs.<br>
It's tiny, but it should have hot water.<br>
You can just steal the soldiers' clothes.&quot;<br>
Shuya nodded and put the Ingram down onto the low desk by the wall.<br>
He clutched Noriko's shoulder.<br>
&quot;Come on, Noriko.<br>
You go first.<br>
Wouldn't want you to get sick again.&quot;<br>
Noriko nodded.<br>
They were about to head towards the stairs when Shogo stopped them.<br>
&quot;Shuya,&quot; he said, &quot;wait, hold on.&quot; He rubbed out his cigarette against the bottom of the helm.<br>
&quot;First I'll show you how to steer this ship.&quot;<br>
Shuya raised his brow.<br>
He figured that Shogo would take care of guiding the ship.<br>
Come to think of it, Shogo probably wanted to take a shower too.<br>
Shuya and Noriko would have to steer the ship then.<br>
Shuya nodded again and returned to the helm with Noriko.<br>
Shogo took another deep breath and lightly tapped on the wheel.<br>
&quot;I'm steering the ship manually right now.<br>
It's less confusing than having it on auto-pilot.<br>
Now this…&quot; Shogo indicated the lever by the helm.<br>
&quot;It's like an accelerator and brake.<br>
Tilting it forward increases the speed and backwards slows it down.<br>
Simple, huh? And over here…&quot; Shogo pointed at the round meter installed right above the wheel.<br>
The thin needle was tilted leftward.<br>
It was surrounded with numbers and letters indicating directions.<br>
&quot;This is a gyro compass.<br>
It gives our direction.<br>
You see that ocean map?&quot;<br>
Shogo indicated the route they were taking to weave their way through the islands and reach the mainland Honshu from their current position east of Megijima Island.<br>
They would be best off, he said, landing on some hidden beach in Okayama Prefecture.<br>
Then he provided simple instructions for the radar and depth gauge.<br>
He touched his chin.<br>
&quot;That's about it for your crash course.<br>
That's enough to steer this thing.<br>
Now, you always steer right of an oncoming ship.<br>
And the other thing is that you can't stop immediately.<br>
As you approach the shore you have to slow down well in advance.<br>
Got that?&quot;<br>
Shuya raised his brow again.<br>
He wondered, why is he advising me about docking too? He continued to nod, though.<br>
Shogo added, &quot;The notes I gave you guys.<br>
Do you still have them? It actually has your contact information.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah…we have them.<br>
But…you're coming with us, right? Right?&quot;<br>
Shogo didn't respond immediately to Shuya's question.<br>
He took out one of the cigarettes he'd stuffed inside his pocket, put it in his mouth, and lit his lighter.<br>
It lit up…but right then Shuya noticed something strange.<br>
Shogo's hand holding the lighter was trembling.<br>
Noriko seemed to have noticed too.<br>
Her eyes were wide open.<br>
&quot;Shogo—&quot;<br>
&quot;You guys asked me…&quot; Shogo said over Shuya's words, his cigarette dangling from his mouth.<br>
His trembling hand tossed the lighter by the helm.<br>
He continued, &quot;…to come with you to the U.S.&quot; He removed the cigarette from his mouth with his shaking hand and exhaled.<br>
&quot;I thought it over.<br>
But…&quot; He stopped and put his cigarette in his mouth.<br>
He removed it, then he blew out smoke.<br>
&quot;It looks like I won't need to answer that anymore.&quot;<br>
Suddenly, Shogo's body slid down.<br>
His head slumped forward as he fell on his knees.<br>
79<br>
&quot;Shogo!&quot;<br>
Shuya ran over to Shogo and grabbed his right arm and held him up.<br>
Noriko also ran over to him and held his left arm from the other side.<br>
Emptied of strength, Shogo's body felt heavy.<br>
That was when Shuya finally realized how Shogo's back was soaked.<br>
There was a tiny hole right below his neck.<br>
It was Kazuo's shot.<br>
The one Kazuo fired at him.<br>
Shogo claimed it was nothing.<br>
Why…why didn't he treat it immediately!? Or did he know it was fatal? Or…did he delay it so Shuya and Noriko could get aboard?<br>
In their arms, Shogo's body slowly gave way, and he slumped down on his butt.<br>
&quot;I'm sleepy.<br>
Let me sleep,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;No, no, no, no!&quot; Shuya screamed.<br>
&quot;We'll take you to the nearest hospital!&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't be ridiculous,&quot; Shogo laughed and like the two soldiers sprawled in the corner of the room, he lay down on his side.<br>
&quot;Please.&quot; Shuya knelt down and touched Shogo's shoulder.<br>
&quot;Please get up.&quot;<br>
&quot;Shogo.&quot; Noriko was crying.<br>
&quot;Noriko!&quot; Shuya scolded her.<br>
Noriko looked over at Shuya.<br>
&quot;Don't cry! Shogo can't die!&quot;<br>
&quot;Shuya.<br>
Don't get angry with her over nothing,&quot; Shogo kindly admonished him, &quot;You have to be kind to your girl.&quot; Then he added.<br>
&quot;Besides, sorry, but I'm going.&quot;<br>
Shogo's face became increasingly pale.<br>
In contrast, the scar above his left brow was dark red now like a centipede.<br>
&quot;Shogo…&quot;<br>
&quot;I-I-I'm still not sure…&quot; Shogo said.<br>
His head began to tremble.<br>
But he continued moving his lips,<br>
&quot;…whether I'm going to join you.<br>
B-b-but IT w-want to th-thank you guys.&quot;<br>
Shuya shook his head over and over.<br>
He stared at Shogo.<br>
He couldn't say anything.<br>
Shogo raised his trembling right hand.<br>
&quot;G-g-goodbye.&quot;<br>
Shuya held his hand.<br>
&quot;N-N-Noriko, you too.&quot;<br>
Holding back her tears, Noriko held Shogo's hand.<br>
Shuya now realized Shogo was dying.<br>
No, he had already known, but now he was accepting it.<br>
What else could he do? He tried to come up with something to say.<br>
He knew what it was.<br>
&quot;Shogo.&quot;<br>
Shogo's eyes drowsily shifted over from Noriko to Shuya.<br>
&quot;I'll tear this fucking country down for you! I'll tear it down, goddamn it!&quot;<br>
Shogo grinned.<br>
His hand fell from Noriko's hand onto his chest.<br>
Noriko followed his hand, and squeezed it.<br>
Shogo closed his eyes.<br>
He seemed to be grinning again.<br>
Then he said, &quot;I-I-I-I-I told you, Sh-Sh-Sh-Shuya.<br>
Y-y-you d-don't h-have to d-d-do th-th-that.<br>
F-f-forget about i-i-it.<br>
You't-t-t-two sh-sh-should just try't-to 1-1-live, p-p-please.<br>
J-j-just like w-w-we d-did here,'t-t-trust each other.<br>
A-a-all right?&quot;<br>
Shogo said this much and took a long, deep breath.<br>
His eyes remained shut.<br>
&quot;That's what I want,&quot; he declared.<br>
That was it.<br>
Shogo stopped breathing.<br>
The dim yellow light falling from the ceiling of the pilothouse shined against his pale face.<br>
He seemed at ease.<br>
&quot;Shogo!&quot; Shuya yelled.<br>
He still had more to say.<br>
&quot;You'll see Keiko! You'll be happy with her! You're—&quot;<br>
It was too late.<br>
Shogo couldn't hear anything anymore.<br>
But his face just looked so damned peaceful.<br>
&quot;Damn it.&quot; Shuya's lips trembled along with his words.<br>
&quot;Damn it.&quot;<br>
Holding Shogo's hands, Noriko was crying.<br>
Shuya also put his hand on Shogo's thick hand.<br>
A thought occurred to him.<br>
He searched through Shogo's pockets and found it…the red bird call.<br>
He pressed it into Shogo's right hand and closed his hands over it so he could hold it.<br>
Shuya then finally burst into tears.<br>
Epilogue<br>
UMEDA, OSAKA<br>
In the bustling crowd at the Umeda-Osaka train terminal, each pedestrian busy for whatever reason, Shuya Nanahara (Male Student No.<br>
15, Third Year Class B, Shiroiwa Junior High School) heard the announcement, &quot;We have this report on the recent murder of a Program Instructor in Kagawa Prefecture,&quot; as he was stepping off one of the pair of escalators that ran along the station's wide stairways.<br>
He gently squeezed Noriko Nakagawa's (Female Student No.<br>
15, same school) shoulder with his right hand and stopped.<br>
On the giant TV screen as high as the escalator, there was a large, closeup image of a reporter in his fifties, his hair parted in a 7:3 ratio.<br>
Shuya and Noriko walked up to the screen together.<br>
It was Monday, past 6 p.m., so there were students and salarymen in business suits waiting around the area.<br>
Shuya and Noriko were no longer wearing their school uniforms.<br>
Shuya wore a pair of jeans, a print shirt, and a denim jacket.<br>
Noriko also wore jeans along with a dark-green polo shirt and a light-gray windbreaker on top.<br>
(They did however keep their sneakers, washing them after the game before they wore them again.) Shuya's neck was bandaged, but it was hidden by the jacket collar, and Noriko's left cheek was covered with a large bandage, but it was obscured by her black leather baseball cap that she kept pulled low over her eyes.<br>
She still dragged her right leg, but it wasn't so conspicuous anymore.<br>
Since his left arm was still paralyzed, Shuya shifted the bag strap against his left shoulder with his right hand.<br>
Shogo's notes indicated the name of a doctor and his address in the city of Kobe.<br>
A small clinic in the back streets of the city, probably similar to the one Shogo's father ran.<br>
The doctor who still seemed to be in his twenties warmly welcomed them and treated their wounds.<br>
&quot;Shogo's father was a senior of my dad's in medical school.<br>
I owe a lot to that man too, though,&quot; the doctor said.<br>
He seemed to be well-connected, and the following day, that is, yesterday, he arranged their escape from the country.<br>
&quot;Shogo had me hold onto some money just in case of an emergency.<br>
We'll use that.&quot; They would first take a fishing boat from a small fishing village in Wakayama Prefecture into the Pacific Ocean, and then transfer to another boat in the Democratic Nation of the Korean Peninsula.<br>
&quot;You won't have any problems getting from Korea to America.<br>
It'll be the transfer from that first boat that's going to be hard.&quot; The doctor voiced his concern, but Shuya and Noriko really had no other choice.<br>
Noriko called home before they left the doctor's house today.<br>
She first called a close friend from another class, having her relay a message to her family to call the doctor's house from a payphone.<br>
It was a precaution against wiretapping.<br>
Shuya left Noriko alone for a while, but he could hear Noriko's sobbing from the hall where the phone was.<br>
Shuya himself didn't contact the Charity House.<br>
He thanked Ms.<br>
Anno and bade her goodbye in his heart.<br>
He did the same with Kazumi Shintani.<br>
The reporter continued, &quot;Due to the Defense Forces helicopter's dispersal of poison gas over Kagawa Prefecture's Okishima Island, where this Program was held, the inspection of the site was delayed.<br>
However two days after the incident, the inspection was finally held this afternoon.<br>
We now know two students are missing.&quot;<br>
The image changed.<br>
A zoom-lens camera from sea captured police officials and soldiers inspecting the island where Shuya and the others had fought for their lives.<br>
There were piles of corpses.<br>
For a split second, Shuya managed to make out two bodies.<br>
There were Yukie Utsumi and Yoshitoki Kuninobu, on the edge of a black pile of school coats and sailor suits, facing the camera.<br>
Despite the dispersal of poison gas, their faces managed to stay unharmed because they had died indoors.<br>
Shuya clenched his right fist.<br>
&quot;The missing students are Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, third-year students of Shiroiwa Junior High School in Kagawa Prefecture.&quot; The screen now displayed large closeup photos side by side.<br>
They were the same photos used for their student I.D.<br>
cards.<br>
Shuya shifted his eyes, but no one in the crowd staring at the screen seemed to notice them.<br>
An image of an empty coast right beside a mountain appeared.<br>
As the camera zoomed in, a small military-colored patrol ship which had run ashore appeared, and was now being examined by police officials and soldiers on the beach.<br>
This segment was shot immediately after the incident became known, so it was less recent.<br>
&quot;On the early morning of the twenty-fourth, the Kagawa Prefecture Program Instructor Sakamochi's patrol ship was found on the shores of Ushimado-cho in Okayama Prefecture.<br>
Instructor Sakamochi and nine Special Defense Forces soldiers, including Private Tokihiko Tahara were discovered along with the Program's winner, Shogo Kawada.&quot; Sakamochi's closeup photo appeared.<br>
He had long hair.<br>
&quot;Suspecting there was a conflict, the police and Defense Forces officials proceeded to investigate.<br>
Authorities now believe the two missing students from today's report may provide the crucial link to the incident.<br>
They are currently searching…&quot;<br>
The reporter continued, but Shuya was too preoccupied with the following to listen.<br>
It was a short clip subtitled, &quot;Winner Shogo Kawada— Found Dead.&quot; Under normal circumstances, they would have only shown a generic subtitle, &quot;Male Student Winner,&quot; and the short segment would have only been broadcast on the Kagawa Prefecture local news.<br>
Shuya and Noriko watched the news at the Kobe doctor's house several times, but they only showed Shogo's photo.<br>
This was the first time they saw this clip.<br>
Held between the soldiers, Shogo stared into the camera.<br>
Then—<br>
At the end of the clip, which lasted approximately ten seconds, he grinned and raised his right fist with his thumb pointing up.<br>
The crowd staring at the screen sounded dismayed.<br>
They probably thought Shogo was proud about his victory.<br>
But of course that wasn't it at all, Shuya thought as he watched the screen return to the image of the reporter.<br>
Was it a message to him and Noriko? Did he already know he was going to die when he stood in front of the government camera? Or was it just a display of his unique sense of irony?<br>
I'll never know.<br>
Just as Shogo once said.<br>
Then Shuya and Noriko's closeup photos were displayed again.<br>
&quot;Any sightings should be reported to…&quot;<br>
&quot;Let's go Noriko.<br>
We have to hurry,&quot; Shuya whispered.<br>
He took her left hand with his right hand.<br>
They turned away from the screen and began walking.<br>
&quot;Shogo told me…&quot; Noriko said as they walked, holding hands, &quot;before you came back…when you were with Yukie's group, he told me something.&quot;<br>
Shuya tilted his head and looked at Noriko.<br>
Noriko looked up at Shuya.<br>
Her eyes covered by the brim of her hat were moist.<br>
&quot;He said he was glad to have such good friends.&quot;<br>
Shuya looked up and nodded.<br>
He just nodded.<br>
They let a group of six or seven students pass by, and then they started walking again.<br>
Shuya said,<br>
&quot;Noriko.<br>
We'll always be together.<br>
I promised Shogo.&quot;<br>
Noriko seemed to be nodding.<br>
&quot;For now we escape…but some day I'm going to tear this country down.<br>
I'm still keeping the promise I made to Shogo.<br>
I want to tear it down for Shogo, for you, for Yoshitoki, for everyone.<br>
Will you help me when the time comes?&quot;<br>
Noriko squeezed Shuya's hand and replied assertively, &quot;Of course, I will.&quot;<br>
They departed from the crowd.<br>
They stood in front of a ticket dispenser.<br>
Noriko looked up at the display above the ticket machine, took out some change, and counted it out.<br>
Then she stood in line in front of the ticket machine to buy their tickets.<br>
Shuya stood still, waiting for Noriko's turn to come.<br>
It came immediately.<br>
She put the coins into the coin slot.<br>
Shuya casually looked over to his left.<br>
He squinted his eyes.<br>
There was the entrance to the station concourse, and he could make out the Osaka high-rise district, just beyond the road where taxis and cars were passing each other.<br>
A tall, uniformed man emerged from this background, heading straight towards them.<br>
He skillfully dodged the flow of pedestrians and made his way toward Shuya.<br>
It was a policeman's uniform.<br>
There was a gold peach insignia shining at the center of his cap.<br>
With his right hand Shuya slowly reached for the Beretta M92F tucked in the back of his jeans as he looked for an escape route.<br>
There was a road at the entrance opposite the policeman.<br>
If they could get there, they could grab a cab—<br>
Shuya whispered to Noriko, who returned with their tickets, &quot;Forget about the train, Noriko.&quot;<br>
Noriko understood.<br>
She quickly turned and opened her eyes wide after seeing the policeman.<br>
&quot;That way,&quot; Shuya said.<br>
The policeman came running at them.<br>
&quot;We have to run, Noriko! Run as fast as you can!&quot; he said.<br>
As they dashed out, Shuya thought, hey, doesn't that sound familiar.<br>
He glanced behind him.<br>
The police officer held out his gun.<br>
Shuya pulled out his Beretta.<br>
The officer shot immediately.<br>
BANG BANG.<br>
Two sweeping shots, but luckily no one in the crowd, including Shuya and Noriko, was hit.<br>
There were cries though, as some fell to the ground for cover, while others having no idea where the gunfire came from scattered in random directions.<br>
The officer, his gun down, ran toward them again, but then crashed into a fat woman carrying groceries, and clumsily fell.<br>
The woman fell too, and her bag of vegetables for dinner tumbled and slid on the floor.<br>
That was all Shuya saw.<br>
He was looking ahead now.<br>
As he ran next to Noriko, a thought suddenly occurred to him.<br>
The screaming, their hasty footsteps, and the officer warning them to stop all receded as his mind was occupied with this thought.<br>
It might have been inappropriate.<br>
And besides…he'd ripped it off.<br>
Oh, man.<br>
But still he thought this:<br>
Together Noriko we'll live with the sadness.<br>
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul.<br>
Someday girl I don't know when we're gonna get to that place.<br>
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun.<br>
But till then tramps like us baby we were born to run.<br>
The screaming and yelling swelled back, returning with the sound of Noriko's heavy breathing and his heart thumping.<br>
We're still on the run.<br>
That's for sure.<br>
Right on.<br>
This time we're on.<br>
And we won't stop till we win.<br>
Now, once again, &quot;2 students remaining.&quot; But of course they're part of you now.<br>
